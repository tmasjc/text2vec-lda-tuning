1952681,2020-03-02T06:00:32,mParticle raises $45M to help marketers unify customer data,"mParticle, which helps companies like Spotify, Paypal and Starbucks umanage their customer data, is announcing that it has raised $45 million in Series D funding.Co-founder and CEO Michael Katz told me that the company has benefited from broader shifts — like new privacy regulation and the shift away from cookie-based browser tracking — that increase brands; needs for a platform like mParticle  that uses ;modern data infrastructure; to deliver a personalized experience for customers without running afoul of any regulations.As result, he said mParticle has nearly quintupled its revenue since it raised a $35 million Series C in 2017. (The company has raised more than $120 million total.);The challenges that we solve are universal,; Katz said. ;It doesn’t matter if there’s a small company or big company. Data fragmentation, data quality, consistent change in the privacy landscape, consistent change in the technology ecosystem, these are universal challenges.;Perhaps for that very reason, a whole industry of customer data platforms has sprung up since mParticle was founded back in 2013, all offering tools to help marketers create a single view of their customers by unifying data from various sources. Even big players like Adobe and Salesforce have announced their own CDPs as part of their larger marketing clouds.When asked about the competition, Katz said, ;The market has responded overwhelmingly by saying, ;I don’t want one vendor to rule everything for me.; Why be beholden to one suite of tools that;s just an amalgamation of products that were built in the early 2000s?;Instead, he argued that mParticle customers want ;a best-in-breed combination of independent solutions that can be integrated seamlessly.;Getting back to the new funding — Arrowroot Capital led the round, with the firm;s managing partner Matthew Safaii joining mParticle;s board of directors. Existing investors also participated.Katz said the funding will be spent in three broad areas: building new products, scaling its global data infrastructure and finding new partners. In fact, the company is also announcing a partnership with LiveRamp, through which mParticle customers can combine their first-party data with the third-party party data from Liveramp.;We see this partnership with Liveramp as an opportunity to extend the surface area by which our customers can deliver highly personalized, privacy-friendly experiences,; Katz said.Amperity acquires Custora to improve its customer data platform",https://tcrn.ch/2PzOpZd
1952812,2020-03-02T01:00:56,AudioTelligence raises $8.5M Series A to bring its ;autofocus for sound; to voice assistants,"AudioTelligence, a startup that spun out of University of Cambridge-funded CEDAR Audio, has raised $8.5 million in Series A funding for its ;autofocus for sound;.Leading the round is Octopus Ventures, with participation from existing investors Cambridge Innovation Capital, Cambridge Enterprise, and CEDAR Audio.Founded in 2017 and based in Cambridge, U.K., the company has developed data-driven ;blind audio signal; separation technology that is able to remove background noise, enabling the listener ; which can be humans or machines ; to hear the person speaking more clearly.Its potential commercial applications are far ranging, from voice assistants operating in noisy environments, to smart speakers, smart TVs and set-top boxes where broadcast sound and other background noise can interfere with the a device;s ability to perform speech recognition.Another obvious use-case is hearing assistance for people who struggle with hearing in noisy crowds, which the company is also exploring. In fact, the original impetus for the tech was to solve the so-called ;cocktail party problem,; founder and CEO Ken Roberts told me in a video call last week where I was shown a live demonstration of AudioTelligence;s tech working in a very noisy cafe. As controlled as that demo may have been, the results were impressive nonetheless.Roberts also explained that AudioTelligence intends to pursue a licensing strategy rather than build direct to consumer hardware of its own, and recently demonstrated the tech;s capability at CES where it saw a lot of interest from OEMs and others (90 business leads in 4 days, apparently). Furthermore, I;m told that tests with an undisclosed home assistant platform showed that sentence recognition rate in noisy conditions jumped from 22% to 94%.With regards to what might set apart AudioTelligence;s background noise removal tech from existing solutions, Roberts said it doesn’t require ;matched; microphones, which makes it cheaper and easier to implement, and it doesn’t require the user to train the algorithm beforehand. This, the company claims, means AudioTelligence is able to recognise new background sounds and new voices in realtime and adjust its ;focus; accordingly.In addition, the tech claims to offer high performance with very low latency ; good enough to retain lip syncing, which is crucial for hearing assist applications.;Our solution doesn’t need calibrating or training, and the code is production ready,; says Roberts. ;This means existing devices can be easily upgraded to AudioTelligence with no more than a software update;.Meanwhile, AudioTelligence plans to use the new capital for further ;breakthrough; product development, and to support new partnerships with technology providers. This will see the startup triple employee headcount over the next three years.",https://tcrn.ch/2VCj5g0
1952905,2020-03-02T00:54:51,India;s Spinny raises $43.7M to expand its online platform for selling used cars,"Spinny, an online platform for selling used cars, has secured $43.7 million from a cohort of influential investors in a new financing round as it looks to expand to more Indian cities.The Series B financing round for the Gurgaon-based startup was led by the Fundamentum Partnership, the growth-capital fund backed by tech veterans Nandan Nilekani and Sanjeev Aggarwal. US-based General Catalyst Partners, Korea based KB Financial Group and existing investors Accel, SAIF Partners and Alteria Capital also participated in the round.The four-year-old startup has raised about $57 million to date, and according to a person familiar with the matter, the new round gave it a post money valuation of about $150 million.Spinny runs a platform to facilitate sale and purchase of used cars. Niraj Singh, co-founder and chief executive of the startup, told TechCrunch in an interview that Spinny brings the trust factor that people are looking for when they are purchasing a car.“Most of these people are aged under 35. They are aspirational and want to get better cars. But it’s a hassle for them to find a trustworthy place and deal with agents,” he said.The Gurgaon-based four-year-old startup is solving that by inspecting and purchasing the cars and then selling them itself.“Since there are no middlemen, we are able to sell the cars at more affordable prices and we offer a five-day, no-question asked full-refund if someone is not satisfied with their purchase,; he claimed. ;On top of that, we also offer a year-long warranty on these cars.;Spinny operates in four cities in India today and has sold nearly 10,000 cars. Until 2017, the startup acted as a marketplace for sale and purchase of cars, essentially serving as a listing platform. “Then, we pivoted as we wanted to control the full supply chain,” he said.Nandan Nilekani,  co-founder and Chairman of Fundamentum, said the fund was impressed by Spinny’s “full stack business” that is building a competitive differentiation as it scales.“This fits into Fundamentum;s thesis of backing long term oriented entrepreneurs to solve complex business problems using technology and who aspire to build a company at scale and to last,” he said.On Spinny;s website, people can find the car they want to purchase and then inspect and test drive it from the startup’s physical hubs. Spinny currently has nine hubs in India, something it plans to scale to 20 by the end of the year as it scales to more cities in the country.It competes with heavily-backed Cars24 and CarDekho, both of which count Sequoia Capital as an investor, as well as Droom, which has raised over $130 million, and Naspers-owned marketplace Olx.",https://tcrn.ch/2VDV1cD
1952848,2020-03-01T21:45:57,Thought Machine nabs $83M for a cloud-based platform that powers banking services,"The world of consumer banking has seen a massive shift in the last ten years. Gone are the days where you could open an account, take out a loan, or discuss changing the terms of your banking only by visiting a physical branch. Now, you can do all this and more with a few quick taps on your phone screen ; a shift that has accelerated with customers expecting and demanding even faster and more responsive banking services.As one mark of that switch, today a startup called Thought Machine, which has built cloud-based technology that powers this new generation of services on behalf of both old and new banks, is announcing some significant funding ; $83 million ; a Series B that the company plans to use to continue investing in its platform and growing its customer base.To date, Thought Machine;s customers are primarily in Europe and Asia ; they include large, legacy outfits like Standard Chartered, Lloyds Banking Group, and Sweden;s SEB through to ;challenger; (AKA neo-) banks like Atom Bank. Some of this financing will go towards boosting the startup;s activities in the US, including opening an office in the country later this year and moving ahead with commercial deals.The funding is being led by Draper Esprit, with participation also from existing investors Lloyds Banking Group, IQ Capital, Backed and Playfair.Thought Machine, which started in 2014 and now employs 300, is not disclosing its valuation but Paul Taylor, the CEO and founder, noted that the market cap is currently ;increasing healthily.; In its last round, according to PitchBook estimates, the company was valued at around $143 million, which at this stage of funding puts this latest round potentially in the range of between $220 million and $320 million.Thought Machine is not yet profitable, mainly because it is in growth mode, said Taylor. Of note, the startup has been through one major bankruptcy restructuring, although it appears that this was mainly for organisational purposes: all assets, employees and customers from one business controlled by Taylor were acquired by another.Thought Machine;s primary product and technology is called Vault, a platform that contains a range of banking services ; they include current/checking accounts; savings accounts; loans; credit cards and mortgages ; that Thought Machine does not sell directly to consumers, but sells by way of a B2B2C model.The services are provisioned by way of smart contracts, which allows Thought Machine and its banking customers to personalise, vary and segment the terms for each bank ; and potentially for each customer of the bank.Food for Thought (Machine)It;s a little odd to think that there is an active market for banking services that are not built and owned by the banks themselves. After all, aren;t these the core of what banks are supposed to do?But one way to think about it is in the context of eating out. Restaurants; kitchens will often make in-house what they sell and serve. But in some cases, when it makes sense, even the best places will buy in (and subsequently sell) food that was crafted elsewhere. For example, a restaurant will re-sell cheese or charcuterie, and the wine is likely to come from somewhere else, too.The same is the case for banks, whose ;Crown Jewels; are in fact not the mechanics of their banking services, but their customer service, their customer lists, and their deposits. Better banking services (which may not have been built ;in-house;) are key to growing these other three.;There are all sorts of banks, and they are all trying to find niches,; said Taylor. Indeed, the startup is not the only one chasing that business. Others include Mambu, Temenos and Italy;s Edera.In the case of the legacy banks that work with the startup, the idea is that these behemoths can migrate into the next generation of consumer banking services and banking infrastructure by cherry-picking services from the VaultOS platform.;Banks have not kept up and are marooned on their own tech, and as each year goes by, it comes more problematic,; noted Taylor.In the case of neobanks, Thought Machine;s pitch is that it has already built the rails to run a banking service, so a startup ; ;new challengers like Monzo and Revolut that are creating quite a lot of disruption in the market; (and are growing very quickly as a result) ; can integrate into these to get off the ground more quickly and handle scaling with less complexity (and lower costs).Money talksTaylor was new to fintech when he founded Thought Machine, but he has a notable track record in the world of tech that you could argue played a big role in his subsequent foray into banking.Formerly an academic specialising in linguistics and engineering, his first startup, Rhetorical Systems, commercialised some of his early speech-to-text research and was later sold to Nuance in 2004.His second entrepreneurial effort, Phonetic Arts, was another speech startup, aimed at tech that could be used in gaming interactions. In 2010, Google approached the startup to see if it wanted to work on a new speech-to-text service it was building. It ended up acquiring Phonetic Arts, and Taylor took on the role of building and launching Google Now, with that voice tech eventually making its way to Google Maps, accessibility services, the Google Assistant and other places where you speech-based interaction makes an appearance in Google products.While he was working for years in the field, the step changes that really accelerated voice recognition and speech technology, Taylor said, were the rapid increases in computing power and data networks that ;took us over the edge; in terms of what a machine could do, specifically in the cloud.And those are the same forces, in fact, that led to consumers being able to run our banking services from smartphone apps, and for us to want and expect more personalised services overall. Taylor;s move into building and offering a platform-based service to address the need for multiple third-party banking services follows from that, and also is the natural heir to the platform model you could argue Google and other tech companies have perfected over the years.Draper Esprit has to date built up a strong portfolio of fintech startups that includes Revolut, N26, TransferWise and Freetrade. Thought Machine;s platform approach is an obvious complement to that list. (Taylor did not disclose if any of those companies are already customers of Thought Machine;s, but if they are not, this investment could be a good way of building inroads.)“We are delighted to be partnering with Thought Machine in this phase of their growth,; said Vinoth Jayakumar, Investment Director, Draper Esprit, in a statement. ;Our investments in Revolut and N26 demonstrate how banking is undergoing a once in a generation transformation in the technology it uses and the benefit it confers to the customers of the bank. We continue to invest in our thesis of the technology layer that forms the backbone of banking. Thought Machine stands out by way of the strength of its engineering capability, and is unique in being the only company in the banking technology space that has developed a platform capable of hosting and migrating international Tier 1 banks. This allows innovative banks to expand beyond digital retail propositions to being able to run every function and type of financial transaction in the cloud.”“We first backed Thought Machine at seed stage in 2016 and have seen it grow from a startup to a 300-person strong global scaleup with a global customer base and potential to become one of the most valuable European fintech companies,; said Max Bautin, Founding Partner of IQ Capital, in a statement. ;I am delighted to continue to support Paul and the team on this journey, with an additional £15 million investment from our £100 million Growth Fund, aimed at our venture portfolio outperformers.”",https://tcrn.ch/2IajKgX
1952644,2020-02-28T15:04:46,Notivize makes it easier for non-technical teams to optimize app notifications,"A new startup called Notivize aims to give product teams direct access to one of their most important tools for increasing user engagement — notifications.The company has been testing the product with select customers since last year and says it has already sent hundreds of thousands of notifications. And this week, it announced that it has raised $500,000 in seed funding led by Heroic Ventures .Notivize  co-founder Matt Bornski has worked at a number of startups, including AppLovin and Wink, and he said he has ;so many stories I can tell you about the time it takes to change a notification that’s deeply embedded in your stack.;To be clear, Bornski isn;t talking about a simple marketing message that;s part of a scheduled campaign. Instead, he said that the ;most valuable; notifications (e.g. the ones that users actually respond to) are usually driven by activity in an app.For example, it might sound obvious to send an SMS message to a customer once the product they;ve purchased has shipped, but Bornski said that actually creating a notification like that would normally require an engineer to write new code.;There’s the traditional way that these things are built: The product team specs out that we need to send this email when this happens, or send this SMS or notification when this happens, then the engineering team will go in and find the part of the code where they detect that such a thing has happened,; he said. ;What we really want to do is give [the product team] the toolkit, and I think we have.;So with Notivize, non-coding members of the product and marketing team can write ;if-then; rules that will trigger a notification. And this, Bornski said, also makes it easier to ;A/B test and optimize your copy and your send times and your channels; to ensure that your notifications are as effective as possible.He added that companies usually don;t build this for themselves, because when they;re first building an app, it;s ;not a rational thing to invest your time and effort in when you’re just testing the market or you’re struggling for product market fit.; Later on, however, it can be challenging to ;go in and rip out all the old stuff; — so instead, you can just take advantage of what Notivize has already built.Bornski also emphasized that the company isn;t trying to replace services that provide the ;plumbing; for notifications. Indeed, Notivize actually integrates with SendGrid and Twilio to send the notifications.;The actual sending is not the core value [of what we do],; he said. ;We;re improving the quality of what you’re paying for, of what you send.;Notivize allows customers to send up to 100 messages per month for free. After that, pricing starts at $14.99 per month.“The steady march of low-code and no-code solutions into the product management and marketing stack continues to unlock market velocity and product innovation,” said Heroic Ventures founder Michael Fertik in a statement. ;Having been an early investor in several developer platforms, it is clear that Notivize has cracked the code on how to empower non-technical teams to manage critical yet complex product workflows.;OneSignal raises $7M for its free push notification tools",https://tcrn.ch/388W4UL
1949688,2020-02-28T14:45:47,Pioneer founder Daniel Gross on bringing remote teams together,"There are plenty of accelerators aiming to sway young startups to join their ranks rather than apply to Y Combinator, but Pioneer;s sell is a bit different.First off, they are fully remote; founders selected to participate in the program chat with advisors via video chat. Second, Pioneer is largely looking at companies that aren;t companies yet, framing themselves as more of a ;startup generator; than an accelerator that aims to help entrepreneurs outside Silicon Valley zero in on exactly what kind of startup they want to build.Earlier this month, I wrote about the accelerator, which is helmed by former YC partner Daniel Gross .Ex-YC partner Daniel Gross rethinks the acceleratorMy interview with Gross had some interesting longer bouts I didn;t have space to include, so I;m including the salient bits here. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.TechCrunch: Remote work seems to have its challenges; how have you overcome some of the humps of being a remote accelerator?Daniel Gross: My overall view is that remote can replace the majority of real-world interaction. But there;s less inertia, if that makes sense, and so I think you can build real rapport and real relationships through a group video chat on the internet, but it will require much more thinking and effort around it than if you were just meeting up in the real world.",https://tcrn.ch/3celjbs
1952390,2020-02-28T09:24:59,"End Game, the startup behind Zombs Royale, raises $3M","End Game Interactive CEO Yang C. Liu has a refreshingly straightforward description of what he and his co-founder Luke Zbihlyj are up to: ;We’re just building games. And to be honest, we don;t know what we’re doing.;Despite this self-proclaimed ignorance, End Game has just raised $3 million in seed funding from an impressive group of investors: The round was led by the game-focused firm Makers Fund,  with participation from Clash of Clans developer Supercell, Unity CEO David Helgason, Twitch COO Kevin Lin, Twitch VP Hubert Thieblot, Danny Epstien and Alexandre Cohen of Main Street Advisors and music executive Scooter Braun.Liu told me that he and Zbihlyj got their start by building websites tied to existing games, such as PokéVision, a site for finding Pokémon in Pokémon GO. However, they were inspired by the success of simple, browser-based multiplayer games like Slither.io to create games of their own — first Zombs.io, then Spinz.io, then Zombs Royale.Altogether, End Game says its titles have attracted more than 160 million players, with 1 million people playing in a single day. Zombs Royale, in particular, seems to have been a hit — the battle royale game (where a single map can pit up to 100 players against each other) was one of 2018;s most Googled games in the United States.Liu said the team;s success convinced them to focus their efforts on game development: ;Do we want to make products that people simply use, or games that people think about out when they;re going to school, or going to work, or dream about?;Zombs Royale was supposedly built in less than four weeks, but Liu said that after its launch in early 2018, the team spent most of the year maintaining and scaling the game. Then 2019 was all about building a team and creating the next game, Fate Arena, a title in the new Auto Chess genre that;s supposed to launch on PC, mobile and other platforms soon.Liu noted that unlike End Game;s previous work, which featured simple 2D art (;On Zombs Royale and Spinz, I did the art, and it;s terrible;), Fate Arena will feature a ;3D, high-fidelity art style.;But even as the company;s games start looking a little less primitive, the goal is still to develop and iterate quickly. Liu said he hopes to fund ;many tries; at building other cross-platform, multiplayer games with this seed round.;We pride ourselves on rapid experimentation,; he said, adding that the key is ;not biting off more than we can chew. We design [our games] to scale from the beginning. We don’t necessarily need to be World of Warcraft, where you need to make 100 quests as the baseline. We’re focused on games with a small starting point that can scale into something much bigger.;Supercell  Developer Relations Lead Jaakko Harlas made a similar point in a statement included in the funding announcement:Many companies are quick to point out how fast-moving they are. Then you come across a team like this and realize what being lean and moving fast really means. Yang, Luke and the team have already shown that they can ship accessible games that showcase a real flair for fun, and we look forward to supporting them in their quest for the next big hit game.This new venture fund has more than $180 million to invest in interactive entertainment startups&nbsp;",https://tcrn.ch/3cdH5Mu
1952349,2020-02-28T07:27:10,Public markets fall yet again as venture deal counts appear to slip,"Hello and welcome back to our regular morning look at private companies, public markets and the gray space in between.All around, this has been a tough week. The coronavirus is spreading and worry is running high as infections mount. In economic terms, global markets were repeated declines last night (domestic results here), and the U.S. indices are off again this morning.There;s been plenty of bad news to read, even in our private market, startup-focused world. Yesterday the impact of COVID-19 on earnings became more apparent, bringing what has, for months, been an external concern to domestic technology companies. The problems are now. The past week;s market collapse into correction territory hasn;t helped,.But the story so far has largely been public-market focused and with good reason: You can see the public markets contract in real-time. It;s far harder to see into the shifting dynamics of the private market. Today, however, we are going to try, all the same, by digging into some preliminary venture capital data.I realize that the last few days have been awful. So, at the end of this piece, I;ve excerpted a quote from a recent interview I held with the CEO of Smartsheet, Mark Mader, about tech cycles, downturns, and getting through tough times. It;s perhaps useful today as the downward trend appears to continue.Let;s start with a brief reminder of how elevated stock prices remain and what that means for tech multiples, and then look at early February VC results from the U.S., China and Europe. With that, in Sanskrit: अभिमुखी करोति.Multiples, MarketsBefore we dig into the venture capital data, a reminder that, even with recent declines, we;re still in warm waters as far as tech valuations go.",https://tcrn.ch/2wTv4eV
1952052,2020-02-28T07:25:51,Teen hit Yolo raises $8M to let you Snapchat anonymously,"It wasn;t a fad. Yolo became the country;s No. 1 app just a week after launch by letting teens ask for anonymous replies to questions they posted on Snapchat. But nine months later, Yolo is still in the top 100 iOS apps and has 10 million active users. Now it;s safeguarding the app from predators while revealing a smart new feature for spinning up anonymous group chats, powered by $8 million in fresh funding.;What we are trying to build is a new kind of network where there;s a fluidity to identity,; Yolo co-founder Greg Henrion tells me. ;We weren;t sure if Yolo was here to stay, but we;re still ranking well and there seems to be a real opportunity in anonymity starting with Snapchat Q&amp;A.;Yolo is the first big win for Snapchat;s Snap Kit platform that lets developers piggyback on its login, Bitmoji avatars, stickers and Stories. This lets tiny development teams build apps that hundreds of millions of people, teens in particular, can instantly sign up for in just a few taps. Another Snap Kit app for meeting new people called Hoop recently spiked to No. 2 on the chartsWe haven;t seen this kind of social platform success since Zynga;s empire rose atop Facebook. Spawning more blockbusters like Yolo could ensure that a Snapchat account is a must-have utility for the next generation.Sleepless nights atop the charts;For two weeks we basically didn;t sleep,; Henrion recalls about the chaos he and co-founder Clément Raffenoux endured after Yolo shot to No. 1 last May. ;You;re trying to stay afloat. It was very, very wild.;The basic premise of Yolo is that you write a question like, ;Who;s my celebrity look alike?;, ;What do people really think of me?; or ;How could I be nicer?; You;re then switched over to Snapchat, where you can post the question in your Story or messages with a link back to Yolo. There, people can anonymously leave a response; you can post that and your reply with another post on Snapchat.Yolo co-founder and CEO Greg Henrion, in real life and BitmojiThe result is that friends and followers feel comfortable giving you real talk. They don;t have to sugarcoat their answers. And that makes people race to open Yolo each time they get a message. Yolo has seen 26 million downloads across iOS and Android globally, with nearly 70% in the U.S, according to Sensor Tower.Other anonymous apps like tbh (acquired by Facebook) and Sarahah (kicked off the app stores) quickly faded, and others eventually imploded due to bullying, like Secret and YikYak. Although tbh hit No. 1 in September 2017, it was out of the top 500 by November. It seems a combination of inherent virality via Snapchat, easy user acquisition via Snap Kit and sharp product design has given Yolo some staying power. It still managed 2.2 million downloads last month versus a peak of 5.5 million in its first month back in May 2019.That June, Yolo quietly raised a $2 million seed round thanks to its sudden success. The team had been grinding since 2017 on a video reactions app called Popshow funded by a small pre-seed round from SV Angel, Shrug Capital and Product Hunt’s Ryan Hoover. They;d previously built music video-making app Mindie that eventually sold to influencer collective Shots Studios. Popshow never caught on, so the team began experimenting on Snap Kit, building a more official Q&amp;A feature for Snapchat than predecessors like Sarahah and Polly. Then, boom. Days after launch, Yolo;s usage exploded.But to keep users interested, Yolo needed to evolve. That would require more funding for the eight-person team split between Snapchat;s home of Los Angeles and Henrion;s home of Paris.An honest way to chatThe concept of a social app where users could shift between full anonymity and representation via avatar attracted its $8 million Series A to invest in product and engineering. The round was led by Thrive Capital,  Ron Conway;s A.Capital, former TechCrunch editor Alexia Tsotsis; Dream Machine (also in the seed round), Shrug, Day One, Goodwater, Knight VC, ex-Facebooker Bobby Goodlatte, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone and SV Angel;s Brian Pokorny.That cash fueled the release of Yolo;s new group chat feature. You can set up a chat room, give it a name and generate an invite URL or sticker you can post on Snapchat, just like its previous question feature. Friends or friends of friends that are already in can join the group chat, represented by their Bitmoji instead of their name. Yolo suggests people join the more open ;party mode; chats where their friends are active.What makes this special is that once an hour, users can tap the Yolo Superpowers button to send  a totally anonymous message to the group. More Superpowers are coming, but there;s also an anonymous ;Someone has a crush on [name]; message so you can secretly profess your affection to anyone or someone else in the chat.;The limits of Q&amp;A is that it doesn;t generate real conversation. It;s an ice breaker, but we also want conversations to happen,; Henrion stresses. ;;What do you think about this dress?; The group chat is more about ;let;s talk about the dress.'; The chats could be focused on people you actually know offline, or those you share interests with. The option to restrict group chats to either just your contacts or friends of friends ;limits the amount of meeting strangers,; Henrion explains. ;This is very different from the public communities like Reddit or the dating apps.;Can ;anonymous; be synonymous with ;safe;?Still, anonymous apps have consistently proven to be havens for cyberbullying and unsafe behavior. Without the accountability of having your name attached, people are free to say awful things. That can be even worse amongst teenagers who might get in trouble for being mean at school but not on an app.Yolo first focused on messages blocking 10% of overall messages that contained offensive content. That meant blatant hate speech and trolling couldn;t spread through the app. ;We;re strict on moderation. When looking at the reviews about bullying, it;s like nothing compared to any other anonymous app. I think we solved 90% of the problem.;Now it;s working with Snapchat to safeguard the group chats feature. The goal is to ensure Yolo doesn;t actively recommend chat amongst adults to minors and vice-versa. Henrion says this update should roll out soon.;It;s 2020 and we need to be very responsible; Henrion tells me. ;Moderation and growth are the most difficult things to balance. It;s moderation first for sure. We don;t care about growth if it;s not healthy or sustainable.; The new funding also gives Yolo the luxury of pushing back monetization while it focuses on safely adding more users.By making anonymity more private, Yolo has a chance to sidestep some of the worst elements of human behavior. Making fun of someone has less appeal if there;s no wider audience like trolls exploited in the feeds and comment reels of Secret and YikYak.That could let the brighter side of anonymity shine through: vulnerability, honesty and deep connections that are enhanced by the absence of embarrassment. With all the change, uncertainty and anxiety that;s part of growing up, teens deserve a place where they can be open with each other and speak their minds. After all, you only live once.",https://tcrn.ch/3abTRt6

1949814,2020-02-27T23:07:50,Indian research firm Convergence Catalyst is ready for its second act,"A 9-year-old is smashing the shuttle far and wide, frantically pacing back and forth on the court in Bangalore, India, as her competition refuses to back down. Her rival is not a human. She is playing against a machine that is mimicking the game of badminton legend P.V. Sindhu, toned down a few notches to adjust for the age difference.By the court, her father, Jayanth Kolla, is watching the game and taking notes. Kolla is a familiar name in the tech startup and business ecosystem in India. For the last eight years, he has been helming the research firm Convergence Catalyst, which covers mobility, telecom, AI and IoT.When his daughter showed interest in badminton, Kolla rushed to explore options, only to realize that the centuries old sports could use some deep tech.He reached out to a few friends to explore if they could build a device. ;I have always wondered how a younger version of players who have made it to the professional arena must have played like,; he said in an interview.Months later, they had something better.Sensate TechnologiesKolla founded Sensate Technologies last year and has hired many industry experts and data scientists from Stanford, MIT, and India;s IIT. Sensate is building solutions on deep technologies such as AI, ML, advanced analytics, IoT, robotics and blockchain.In the last year, the bootstrapped startup has developed seven prototypes, five of which are for sports. It holds eight patents, which brings us back to the court.One of the prototypes that Sensate has built is the machine that Kolla;s daughter is playing against. In a recent interview, he demonstrated how Sensate was able to accurately map how a player moves on the court and goes about smashing the shuttle by just looking at two-dimensional videos on YouTube and a mobile camera feed. This has been built using Computer Vision AI.It then fine tunes the gameplay in accordance with the age difference, which is input into a machine that can now mimic that player to a great level, said Kolla.A handful of startups and established players have sought to address the sports tech market in recent years. SeeHow, another India-based startup, builds and embeds sensors in bats and balls to track specific types of data that batsmen and bowlers generate.Kolla;s aim is to turn Sensate Technologies into a global deep tech venture foundry and build 20 odd products that would then branch into multiple companies operating in 11 different industries.Microsoft last year partnered with Indian cricket legend Anil Kumble’s company Spektacom to work on a number of solutions including a smart sticker for bats that contains sensor tech designed to track the performance.But Kolla’s ambitions go way beyond sports tech.“The best part about deep technology solutions and platforms is that you build solutions on these technologies to solve a problem in a particular sector and with very little incremental effort, they can solve problems in a completely different sector,” he said.Kolla, a former product manager at Motorola and Nokia, among other companies, said the startup is also in discussion with one of the world;s biggest companies that is looking to license its tech for their healthcare stack. ;This validates our approach.; He declined to name any potential clients as the talks have not materialized yet.",https://tcrn.ch/2uCFaQJ
1949167,2020-02-27T15:58:13,SeeHow helps cricketers train smarter,"Like baseball, cricket relies on grass, dirt, wood, cork, spit, spin, drop and rise en route to either victory or loss. And like baseball ; and just about any other sport, really ; cricket coaching staffs and their players worldwide are looking for more ways to track every move.Tracking statistics is nothing new. With each action, a player produces a stat that can be used to track improvement or struggle over a given period of time. But as players get stronger and stakes ; financial and otherwise ; get higher, a need for more specific data is proving necessary.India-based SeeHow transforms sports equipment into sensors to do just that, and it does so without having to alter anything on the athlete’s body. Its sensors are baked into cricket balls and bat handles to track very specific types of data that batsmen and bowlers generate. And tracking the behavior of a bowled ball and where and how it lands on a bat all play a role in the story of cricket.;Putting the sensor inside the ball or bat handle where the action is happening is when you can capture data fundamentally at a higher accuracy,” says Dev Chandan Behera, founder and CEO of SeeHow . “Most MEMS [micro-electro-mechanical systems] can measure up to 2,000 degrees per second, i.e about 300+ RPMs. International spinners like Shane Warne can spin the ball up to 3,000 RPMs. This is something we are able to capture.”To obtain data, a trainer first assigns a bowler and/or a batsman in the accompanying Android app before a session. (Behera says an iOS app is due this year.) During play, each action is captured in near real time for each corresponding player.﻿For bowlers, the sensor tracks speed, spin, seam position or orientation, and length ; where the ball lands on the pitch. For batsmen, the sensor tracks swing speed and angle, where it hits on the bat, what kind of deliveries they played, what their responses were to a particular delivery and the velocity of the ball off the bat.This data is then streamed in real time and can be read by players and coaches alike on the app. The app retains a history of a player’s progress in order to make any necessary adjustments and to track improvements.“In bat on ball sport or racquetball sport, you;re doing something in response to the pitcher or your opponent, and that;s something we;re able to capture into a single system,” Behera says. Because both the data from the batter and the bowler are streaming to a single system, he adds, the app is able to tell users what the reaction time is.Behera grew up playing cricket with the intention of improving enough to ensure his rise through the ranks.“Growing up we would use chalk, cones or a sheet of A4 paper as markers during play to assess how we bowled,” Behera says of his early years. “A coach would use a slate to mark the number of balls bowled and selection would be based on whether you had his attention in that particular window when he happened to look at you playing. You might just have a bad day and not get selected to the next level.”After moving to Singapore, Behera continued competing in the sport, and says he was exposed to more tools and more methodical training approaches.;We used to record videos through mobile phone cameras and compare them to videos on YouTube or show it to our seniors or coaches for tips,; he says. ;However, the process was very ad hoc, and without any data and science to it, it was subjective. We never improved and made it as cricketers.”His experience building robots, combined with his cricket playing, prompted him to consider using a ball as a way to glean data to help improve cricketers’ performances.“It occurred to me that we could address this issue by bringing in a new perspective to the ball itself. The experience of building such complex hardware helped me gauge the challenges we needed to build a sports operating system that will enable sensors in the field of play to provide this holistic learning experience in cricket.”Behera says SeeHow’s sensors are being used at 12 cricket academies in nine countries. First-class cricketer Abhishek Bhat is a fast bowler whose speed topped at 120km. He writes that after two weeks, he was able to push his pace into the mid 130s:However, it wasn’t until SeeHow came into the picture that I was able to get a consistent measurement of my bowling speed, session after session and day after day. I cannot overstate the impact bowling with the smart ball has had on my bowling speed.I had my first bowling session with the smart ball in early November and I was bowling in the mid-120s, barely getting above 130kmph. Then with some technical adjustments in a couple of weeks time, I was consistently bowling close to the 130 kmph mark. It was then that I realized that bowling fast is more than just about technique, it’s about the mindset.SeeHow isn’t the only company trying to improve the way cricketers train.A company called StanceBeam has developed a system that, among other things, provides session insights, the power generated from a swing, angles and directions of a swing and a 3D analysis of a batsman’s swing. It does so through a hardware extension that players attach to the ends of their bats and that relays data via an app.Microsoft is also in the game of cricket analysis. The company partnered with star India cricketer Anil Kumble and his company Spektacom to enhance the reach of its sensor, which is designed to help better engage fans and broadcasters through the use of embedded sensors, artificial intelligence, video modeling and augmented reality. The company’s first offering is a smart sticker for bats that contains sensor tech designed to track batting behavior that is readable via an app.As cricket starts to find an audience beyond the Commonwealth countries and continues to draw big dollars, look for tech to play a bigger role in attracting and maintaining audiences and players.For SeeHow, cricket is just the beginning.“Baseball is a very natural extension to cricket if you look at how the sport is played and the equipment,” Behera says. “And we have also done mixed martial arts with sensors in the gloves.”The company has filed for five patents, one of which, Behera says, is around the construction of the ball, specifically in order to be able to hold the vibrations.“We have mounted the sensor in the sports equipment at the core and introduced a protective material to cushion the sensor from impact and vibration,” he says. “The patent captures the construction of the ball that mounts the sensor and introduces the protective material in a novel manner to be able to capture the motion data at the core.”As it scales, SeeHow will look to license the hardware to equipment manufacturers and become a platform company. SeeHow is funded through a friends and family round and is currently in search of seed funding.Indian research firm Convergence Catalyst is ready for its second act",https://tcrn.ch/2VvwVRE
1952204,2020-02-27T14:56:13,Stem is offering cash advances to help musicians stay independent,"Stem, a startup that helps independent musicians get paid, is expanding with a new financing program called Scale.Co-founder and CEO Milana Rabkin Lewis described the company;s core offering as a way for collaborators to ;memorialize the split; of the proceeds from a song — once they;ve uploaded a track, Stem can automatically handle splitting the payments among those collaborators. It also offers a broader suite of tools, including revenue data, to help musicians manage the financial side of their careers.However, Rabkin Lewis noticed that some musicians on Stem were starting to ;graduate; by signing a deal with a record label, usually because they needed capital: ;Sometimes that was money for marketing, sometimes it was money for production, sometimes it was the cost of going on tour.;With Scale, Rabkin Lewis and her team are trying to offer something better — a way for musicians to get access to the money they need without having to sign a restrictive contract. The payment terms are transparent; they;re calculated as a percentage of monthly revenue, with musicians able to adjust how much money they take and how quickly they want to pay it back.Plus they;re able to maintain creative control and full ownership of their master recordings. And Stem says these advances are better from a tax perspective, because they;re classified as a merchant credit advance that only gets taxed as money is actually earned.Money might not be the only thing a musician needs, but Rabkin Lewis (a former agent at the United Talent Agency) said that marketing and other services that were once the sole domain of record labels are now available through independent professionals. And Stem already helps connect artists to those specialists through its Stem Direct membership program.While Scale is officially launching today, Stem has already been testing the program with select artists. Rabkin Lewis said the advances vary from $2,500 to $250,000, with most of them in the $50,000 to $100,000 range, and payback periods ranging from four to 18 months.Artists who have already participated in the program include Brent Faiyaz, Justine Skye and Lil Donald.Rabkin Lewis added that there;s a ;huge white space; when it comes to offering financial services to ;the creative class.;;In the future, I;m excited to be thinking about how artists can collateralize their music,; she said. ;You should be able to take out money against your music to be able to finance your recording studio, or finance your child’s studies. I want to be the platform that understands what it means to be a creative professional and be able to provide the best-in-class services to these people that other segments of workers have access to.;Stem raises $8M to get music artists paid more seamlessly",https://tcrn.ch/2T470Pe

1951532,2020-02-27T13:24:39,"Andreessen Horowitz has backed Run The World, a startup with a timely offering: live online events","Every day, there;s another event-related cancellation owing to concern around coronavirus. Just today Microsoft announced it will not have a presence at the Game Developers Conference in mid-March ;out of an abundance of caution.; Facebook also said today that it is canceling its annual F8 conference scheduled for May over coronavirus-outbreak concerns.The last is a particularly big deal. F8 is by far the largest event that Facebook hosts every year, so it;s little wonder that it plans to host part of the event online.Likely, Facebook will use its own tech toward this end. But there is a new option for other companies that are right now second-guessing their event plans, and that;s Run The World, a year-old, 18-person company that;s based in Mountain View, Calif., and has small teams both in China and Taiwan.What it;s doing: smooshing together every functionality that a conference organizer might need in a time of a pandemic. Think video conferencing, ticketing, interactivity and networking.Who;s backing it: Andreessen Horowitz  largely, though the company ; which has raised $4.3 million in seed funding ; also counts as investors GSR Ventures, Pear Ventures, 122 West Ventures, Unanimous Capital, and angel investors like Kevin Weil, the VP of product at the Facebook subsidiary Calibra; Patreon co-founder Sam Yam; and Jetblue Airways Chairman Joel Peterson.Who started Run The World: Xiaoyin Qu, who is CEO of the company and previously led products for both Facebook and Instagram (;basically anything to do with entertainment influencers and creators,; she says of part of her time at Facebook).She dropped out Stanford;s MBA program after a year to start the company last year with Xuan Jiang, a former colleague who was a technical lead for Facebook events, ads and stories. (Jiang does have a master;s degree ; one in computer science from the Georgia Institute of Technology.)We talked with Qu yesterday after learning about the company from Connie Chan, the general partner who led the deal for a16z.Qu says the impetus for the startup ties to her mother, a doctor in China who focuses on meningitis and traveled to a conference in Chicago in late 2018 where she made a connection with a Dubai-based physician who was able to share with her some rare, valuable insight into his own work around meningitis.That might not seem so exceptional to those who travel regularly, but it was enough of an ordeal for Qu;s mother ; who had to secure a visa; take off two weeks around the event, including for travel days; and spent a fortune on airfare and accommodations ; that it was the first major trip she;d taken in 35 years.As Qu half-joked, ;It isn;t like at Stanford, where there are events held regularly that [local] doctors can even walk over to.;Indeed, like a lot of founders who solve a pain point for themselves or someone they love, Qu wanted to create a platform where her mother could meet and have meaningful work connections with people regularly, and this would mean remotely, through digitized events.Turns out, her timing is pretty good. Though numerous startups have launched live online events businesses in the past (many of them since shuttered), you can bet many more organizers are thinking about exactly the type of platform that Run The World is fine-tuning right now.Though publicly launched just four months ago, it has already hosted dozens of events and has hundreds in the pipeline, says Qu. One of its customers is Wuhan2020, a large open-source community with more than 3,000 developers who will be using the platform as part of a long-distance hackathon that hopes to produce tech solutions for those affected by coronavirus in Wuhan.Qu also points to an elephant conservation reserve in Laos that was recently able to raise $30,000 from donors in 15 countries across two weeks through a conference it organized on the platform. The reserve had a constrained budget, but being able to bring together a distributed audience (beyond just wealthy donors) for nearly zero overhead (no venue, no catering), turned it into a major success for the organization.Smaller events are finding the platform, too. In just one instance, a dating coach who specializes in working with engineers recently held a workshop. Just 40 people showed up, says Qu, but this individual was able to make $1,300 from the event.Run The World keeps the cost structure simple, taking 25% of ticket sales in exchange for what it provides organizers, from the templates they create, to ticket sales, to payment processing (via Stripe), streaming, enabling social interactions throughout the event, and helping organizers follow up with attendees afterward.Indeed, beyond enabling organizers to reach a wider audience at perhaps a more accessible price point, a big advantage conferred by online events is the potential for more effective networking, insists Qu. For example, rather than walk into a physical space where it;s sometimes hard to know who to talk with about what, Run The World asks every event attendee to create a video profile akin to an Instagram story that can help inform other attendees about who they are.It also organizes related ;cocktail parties; where it can match attendees for several minutes at a time.Naturally, there are also downsides to streamed live events as the world was reminded last year, when a gunman filmed his mass murder of dozens of people in Christchurch, New Zealand on Facebook Live.One could also imagine that those video profiles could attract unwanted attention to some attendees who might rather just watch an event.These are certainly facets of the business about which Qu and Jiang are well aware. While the plan is to keep adding new features (including, potentially, to use LinkedIn to validate attendees; identities), Qu notes that another way to ensure the quality of the events on the platform remains high ; and that attendees feel safe ; is to steer clear of most free events.;When organizers are recruiting their own people and curating a community; of paid attendees who they know or can ostensibly learn more about, it keeps things above the level, she suggests, noting that paid attendees also show up in far greater numbers.As Run The World scales, she concedes, ;we;ll need to figure out new ways.;Certainly, the lessons learned at Facebook and Instagram should help as the business picks up momentum and creates more structure around its offerings. Besides, Qu adds, ;The ideal event to me isn;t one with 2 million people. I;d rather we hosted 2 million events with 50 people.;",https://tcrn.ch/2PwIC6G
1951503,2020-02-27T12:27:49,"Improving the logistics of trucking, San Diego;s Flock Freight raises $50 million",";We want to change the way freight moves,; says Oren Zaslansky, the chief executive and founder of Flock Freight.His company, which has been operating in stealth mode for the last two years, has finally emerged with a new solution for freight shipping that purports to bring in more money to shippers, remove inefficiencies in the current hub-and-spoke model for freight and offer better deals to shipping customers.He;s also got $50 million in financing in the bank in what is one of the largest recent investments in a San Diego-based company.For Zaslansky, the shipping business is a family affair. ;My parents grew up in the moving business; I grew up around both entrepreneurship and freight,; he says.Those twin passions led him to start his own trucking business out of college in the San Diego area. He also launched a brokerage business to support supply chain logistics. The exposure to both is what led Zaslansky to launch Flock Freight  and its big new financing round, which closed earlier this week.The company raised its cash to change the way shippers move small amounts of goods ; those less-than-a-truckload-sized amounts that have to move through hub-and-spoke operations which increase the time goods are on the road and the possibility for breakage as they;re unloaded and reloaded onto different delivery vehicles.;We want to disintermediate the infrastructure of hub and spoke,; says Zaslansky. ;We want to carpool. We use our technology to change the way freight moves.;Zaslansky isn;t talking about very small orders that can be delivered through a service like Roadie ; the delivery company that raised $39 million from investors led by Home Depot back in February 2019.This is still trucking ; it;s a carpool in a 70-foot-long tractor trailer. Flock Freight works by reaching out to small and mid-size trucking companies and integrating their orders onto the shipments that these firms are already making. ;We go to the carriers that are much more used to working with a third party to fill up empty trucks,; Zaslansky says.  Right now, that;s about 15% of the $110 billion freight and logistics trucking market, Zaslansky says.The new investments into Flock Freight came from SignalFire and GLP Capital Partners in mid-February and they were likely drawn to the company;s claims that its service can eliminate damage claims, collect freight from multiple shippers and optimize route delivery for a 40% savings in fuel emissions, and the guaranteed delivery rate of 97.5%. Companies like Tuft &amp; Needle and Titan Supply Group are already using the company;s services, according to a statement from Flock Freight.Flock Freight makes its market by having a window into the spare capacity of trucks and charging shippers for the exact amount of capacity that they;re using. ;We want to go to a shipper and say ; that [cargo] is 75% of the truck and we;ll charge you 75% of the truck,; said Zaslansky. For carriers, they can say that the price they;ve charged is for 100% of the truck and Flock Freight will add another 10 feet of freight and an additional $1,000 into a carrier;s pocket, Zaslansky said.&nbsp;",https://tcrn.ch/2T5QFtq
1951921,2020-02-27T10:51:31,Quick notes on the DoorDash IPO filing,"Earlier today, during an eye-popping market selloff, DoorDash announced that it has privately filed to go public. The decision to file privately will allow the high-valued startup to get its S-1 documents in good order with the SEC before showing the rest of us what it has up its sleeve.The move to announce its private filing is more interesting and could be related to prepping demand for its shares, providing some PR-cover for backer SoftBank,  which could use the assist, or, perhaps, to dampen investor excitement for rival companies, in the face of DoorDash;s implied success and maturity.Whatever the reasons behind the timing — some of which must deal with the capital requirements of long-running cash burn — the filing is a new milestone for the on-demand and gig economies. And how well DoorDash;s filing is received, predicated in no small part on its recent financial performance, will help set sentiment for a number of other, richly backed startups.So let;s remind ourselves of what we know about DoorDash;s financial history. This will give us a workable foundation heading into its eventual S-1, and, we presume, old-fashioned IPO.

Here;s your Daily Crunch for February 27, 2020.1. DoorDash, the $13B on-demand food delivery startup, says it has confidentially filed for an IPOThe company said that its Form S-1 (a draft registration statement) was filed with the SEC and is now being reviewed. It did not say how many shares it would potentially sell, nor the price range for the IPO, nor what the timing of its next steps would be.The timing of the news underscores just how cash-intensive the on-demand food delivery business can be. DoorDash closed its latest round, for $700 million at a $13 billion valuation, in November of last year.2. Roblox raises $150M Series G, led by Andreessen Horowitz, now valued at $4BThe funding comes at a period of significant growth for the gaming platform.

Reddit CEO: TikTok is ‘fundamentally parasitic’At the Social 2030 conference, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman pushed back hard on the notion that Silicon Valley startups had something to learn from TikTok, saying, ;Maybe I’m going to regret this, but I can’t even get to that level of thinking with them. Because I look at that app as so fundamentally parasitic, that it’s always listening, the fingerprinting technology they use is truly terrifying, and I could not bring myself to install an app like that on my phone.”4.

1951988,2020-02-27T09:40:58,Newlab and The Boston Globe team up to launch AI tools startup Applied XLabs,"Applied XLabs is a new startup building tools that can automate data-gathering for journalists — and eventually, for knowledge workers in other industries.The company is emerging from Brooklyn-based Newlab, with The Boston Globe as its launch partner. It will be led by Francesco Marconi (pictured above), who was previously R&amp;D chief at The Wall Street Journal and head of AI strategy at the Associated Press.Marconi told me that there;s a tremendous amount of data out there that could be useful to journalists, whether that;s inside public company filings or academic climate change research. But data-driven journalism remains a sliver of the industry, because ;only a handful of organizations have the internal resources to create these types of tools, these types of analyses.;The plan is for Applied XLabs to develop products to help newsrooms, starting with The Globe, automatically pull data and generate insights.Vinay Mehra, president of The Boston Globe,  said the hope is to use AI to improve the information that Globe journalists provide to different communities.A new hope: AI for news mediaFor example, Mehra said that The Globe has been expanding its coverage in Rhode Island, partly in response to the disappearance of local newspapers and the resulting ;news deserts.; When the team started talking to the community about what kind of coverage they wanted to see, they came up with a long list of ideas like restaurant openings and closings. (That;s something news startup Hoodline, co-founded by Extra Crunch Managing Editor Eric Eldon, has also tried to tackle with data and automation.)But providing comprehensive coverage in these areas is tough with a small newsroom, Mehra said: ;We can;t keep throwing journalists at this.; So the idea is to ;mine that data; and make existing journalists more effective.At the same time, he emphasized that he doesn;t see AI as a way to replace journalists or justify newsroom cuts, and he noted that The Globe continues to hire.;We can’t sit back and ignore these technologies that are coming out every day,; Mehra said. ;The opportunity here is to redefine what is possible with AI, to expand our own thinking and horizons around how we do journalism today and how we serve these communities.;Marconi added that ultimately, these tools could also be sold to knowledge workers in a variety of industries.;The same way that you have Salesforce for managing the sales process, we are building the platform for knowledge workers,; he said. ;The reason why it’s so important to start with news and why we;re working with journalists [is] the threshold is really, really high. If you are able to build products and seeds of information that editors can use and sign off on, then you can quickly expand into other industries.;Applied XLabs is also the first startup to emerge from Newlab;s venture studio program. When we first visited Newlab back in 2016, it described itself as a workspace for companies in robotics, AI and other fields. Now it has created a studio model where it aims to bring together ;diverse stakeholders; to create new companies in frontier tech.;There is a substantial investment from Newlab, and in addition to capital, Newlab is providing all of the back-office services,; Marconi said. ;I get the stability of an established company with the freedom, flexibility and creativity of a new venture.;New Lab is a new home for hardware startups in Brooklyn;s Navy Yard",https://tcrn.ch/2I3GRKa
1951883,2020-02-27T06:58:52,"DoorDash, the $13B on-demand food delivery startup, says it has confidentially filed for an IPO","The on-demand food delivery wars continue to heat up in the U.S. DoorDash announced today that it has filed confidentially to go public. The company noted that its Form S-1, a draft registration statement, was filed with the SEC and is now being reviewed. It did not say how many shares it would potentially sell, the share price range for the IPO or what the timing of its next steps would be.A public listing would be another way for the company to pick up a significant injection of capital at a key time in the on-demand delivery industry, where competition is fierce and we;re seeing a lot of consolidation globally. The timing of the news also underscores just how cash-intensive this business can be. DoorDash  ; which by some estimates currently leads the food delivery market in the U.S. ; closed its latest round only in November last year, just over three months ago. That was for $700 million at a $13 billion valuation.In the U.S. ; which is DoorDash;s main market, alongside Canada, Puerto Rico and Australia ; the company is understood to have 38% of the market. It operates in heated, and subsequently expensive, rivalry with the likes of Postmates (10% share) and Uber Eats (20%), and more legacy players like Grubhub (31%). That fierce competition is very capital-intensive and has led to rumors over the few years that the company has explored mergers with Uber Eats and Postmates.But DoorDash has also had its share of controversy, specifically around labour issues and how it interfaces with and pays its thousands-strong workforce of contractors. It also faced a data breach last year that affected nearly 5 million consumers, workers and merchants. It also has been quietly building up its technology stack, with acquisitions like Scotty Labs to explore autonomous driving systems (to complement or potentially replace human delivery drivers).Confidential IPO filings allow startups that are still in ;growth; mode (and often unprofitable) to explore the early stages of setting themselves up for a public listing without the public scrutiny that comes with the process. Although it has been popularised by companies like Spotify and Slack ; both of which went public ; it doesn;t always lead to an IPO. Witness WeWork;s filing and subsequent U-turn after it disclosed more details about how the company worked. And Postmates, which filed for an IPO a year ago, has subsequently raised money and is said to be delaying any public moves.More to come.",https://tcrn.ch/2T2EwFy

Berlin-based Cherry Ventures led the round, and Munich;s 42Cap, which led Cioplenu;s pre-seed round in 2018, joined three fairly high-profile angels in the round.The three angels include Fabian Heinrich, co-founder of Scoutbee (which recently announced a $60 million Series B), Christian Heinrich, founder and professor for digital transformation, and Moritz Zimmermann, co-founder of Hybris (which exited to SAP for $1.5 billion in 2013).Billed as a SaaS for ;deskless; workers, Cioplenu aims to digitize an array of production floor processes like maintenance, on-boarding, assembly, and inspection. The software works on any device and can connect to existing IT infrastructure used by production companies. It is already being used in more than 10 countries by large corporates such as Bosch,  Stabilo and Hirschvogel.;If you walk into a typical industrial company today you will find 10 meters of cabinets full of folders with paper protocols, documents, instructions etc.,; explains Cioplenu co-founder and CEO Benjamin Brockmann.;Most maintenance and inspection is not done digitally today and assembly instructions are simply printed out. Finding or sharing documents is a nightmare and there is also no real-time communication or any kind of analytics, which creates a huge blindspot for companies;.To help solve this, Brockmann says Cioplenu is building an intuitive ;operating system; for the production floor that acts as an all-in-one platform for maintenance, inspection, work assembly and other processes.;We provide an easy editor with which multimedia documents, protocols, and questionnaires can be created as well as an operator software for the deskless worker that works on any device,; he explains. ;Our easy ERP integration allows [production companies] to pull in and organize data quickly, while our analytics platform helps companies to optimize their processes. Sounds easy, but to make it enterprise-ready, we also built in many other features, like, for example, complex access rights management;.Cioplenu customers are described as SMBs and enterprises in the industrial market, such as Bosch  or Stabilo, while its user base spans across different departments and organisational levels.For example, a quality manager might use the software for documentation by completing the respective protocol checklists digitally while walking across the production floor with a tablet.;When something is broken, she can snap a photo, annotate it and log it. When she wants to share her protocol with her foreign co-worker, she can send it in a click and it gets automatically translated,; says Cioplenu.The team leader then receives all the consolidated reports with anomalies highlighted, and the facility head gets a real-time overview and analytics on whether or not everything is running according to plan.;The beauty is that because of its modular format, inspection is really just one use case of many,; adds Cioplenu;s CEO. ;[Our software] is also being used for teaching workers how to assemble plants, how to troubleshoot machines and much more;.Meanwhile, Cioplenu says that strong demand for its product will see it open a second office in Frankfurt. “We plan to triple our team this year with big hiring plans for our new office in Frankfurt. Key will be the expansion of our marketing and sales team,; says the startup;s other co-founder Daniel Grobe.",https://tcrn.ch/2HYsLtn

Investors include Rakuten Capital, White Star Capital, JAFCO Asia and GEC-KIP Fund, along with participation from South Korean food delivery app Woowa Brothers, and returning investors Partech Partners and Y Combinator.This brings Dahmakan;s total funding to about $28 million. Its previous round of financing was announced last May.Launched by former executives from Foodpanda, Dahmakan was the first Malaysian startup to participate in Y Combinator’s startup accelerator program. Operational costs for food delivery companies are notoriously high and eat away at profitability, but Dahmakan is among several startups that use “cloud” kitchens, located closer to customers, to reduce delivery costs.The foundation of the startup’s full-stack platform is an operating system that controls nearly every step of its operations, from recipe development to last-mile delivery, and its cloud kitchens are part of “satellite” hubs placed around different cities to be closer to customers.Instead of delivering from restaurants, Dahmakan creates its own meals, offering about 40 options each week from a database of 2,000 dishes. It selects its weekly menu based on customer data, including food preferences and spending habits, along with market research.Then customers are given a menu and pick from a schedule of delivery times. Other startups trying to make food delivery more efficient in Southeast Asia by using a vertically-integrated model and cloud kitchens include Grain, which is backed by investors including Openspace Ventures, First Gourmet and Singha Ventures.In a press statement about Dahmakan’s funding, White Star Capital managing partner Eric Martineau-Fortin said ;Dahmakan is well-positioned to serve the growing demand for food delivery services in Southeast Asia with its unique, technology-forward approach of taking control of the entire value chain to provide affordable delivery options to SEA’s rising middle class.;",https://tcrn.ch/2TmiOuT
1950198,2020-02-26T19:19:30,Vice President Mike Pence will lead the US response to the COVID-19 outbreak,"In an early-evening press conference, President Donald Trump tapped Vice President Mike Pence  to lead the U.S. response to the COVID-19 outbreak that has spread through Europe, Asia and Latin America.The new coronavirus strain, which has infected about 81,000 people around the world and killed 3,000, has already wrought havoc on the global economy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned yesterday that the U.S. will likely not be able to escape the spread of the virus.“It’s not a question of if this will happen but when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illnesses,; said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in a press conference given by the Centers for Disease Control on Tuesday. “Disruption to everyday life might be severe.;Earlier this evening, California reported its first case of community transmission, which was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control, according to The New York Times. That;s a case where an infected person was not exposed to anyone known to be infected with the virus and had not traveled to countries where the virus had spread.THREAD: On New #COVID19 Diagnosis in California Tonight: We will have community spread of #coronavirus in the U.S. It is likely that we have — right now — more cases that remain undiagnosed but will soon be revealed. We need to keep in mind several key points: 1/n&mdash; Scott Gottlieb, MD (@ScottGottliebMD) February 27, 2020Speaking alongside Pence; Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases head Dr. Anthony Fauci; and principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control Dr. Anne Schuchat, the President stressed that the U.S. government was ;very, very ready; to respond to the disease.Vice President Pence said that the White House would continue to work closely with state and local officials, add additional personnel and work with Congress to ensure that the necessary resources are available. ;The threat to the American public remains low,; Pence said.The White House is asking Congress for $2.5 billion to support efforts to stop the spread of the virus in the U.S. while Senate Democrats led by Chuck Schumer have put an $8.5 billion price tag on the coronavirus fight.Secretary Azar outlined five areas where the government would look to spend money including: monitor the spread of the virus, cooperate with local governments, develop therapeutics, develop vaccines, and manufacture and purchase personal protective equipment.Diagnosing the illness has been a particular problem for the U.S. According to multiple reports, the CDC isn;t prepared to test for a potentially rapidly expanding number of cases in the U.S.Only 12 of the 100 public health labs in the U.S. are able to diagnose the coronavirus because of problems with a test developed by the CDC, according to a Politico report.What happens if a pandemic hits?Better diagnostics tools are going to be one of the critical areas where startups could play a role in combating the spread of the virus.;Where startups are going to make contributions is in detection, monitoring, epidemiological predictions, sequencing, supply chain [and] distribution logistics,; wrote James Birch, an entrepreneur and former researcher with the American College of Surgeons.Scott Gottlieb, the former Food and Drug Administration chief and an investor with New Enterprise Associates, has advocated for the expansion of Emergency Use Authorizations from the organization he used to lead as a way to respond to the need for more, better diagnostic tests.THREAD ON DIAGNOSTICS: In recent public health emergencies there’s been a stepwise approach to ramp up U.S. testing capacity. CDC develops test early in outbreak, then pursuant to Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from FDA CDC makes test available to network of public health labs&mdash; Scott Gottlieb, MD (@ScottGottliebMD) February 24, 2020The lack of effective tests available to public health facilities calls into question exactly how prepared the government is for the potential health crisis. In fact, the White House got rid of the pandemic response group in the Administration in a cost-cutting measure in 2018.California;s recently diagnosed new case also casts doubt on the government;s ability to effectively respond to the emerging illness. As the University of California Davis Medical Center wrote in an internal document:“Upon admission, our team asked public health officials if this case could be COVID-19. We requested COVID-19 testing by the CDC, since neither Sacramento County nor (the California Department of Public Health) is doing testing for coronavirus at this time. Since the patient did not fit the existing CDC criteria for COVID-19, a test was not immediately administered;;On Sunday, the CDC ordered COVID-19 testing of the patient and the patient was put on airborne precautions and strict contact precautions. The positive test results were announced on Wednesday.Also troubling to some healthcare observers is Pence;s own track record when it comes to healthcare crises.As governor of Indiana, Pence;s inaction led to an outbreak of HIV in one of the state;s more rural counties, according to a report in HuffPost. As drug use soared in the state during the opioid crisis, addicts in the county were also becoming infected with the virus because they were sharing needles. Pence opposed a needle-sharing program, which could have limited the spread of the virus.Fears about how the new coronavirus would impact the economy rattled stock markets earlier this week as news of the disease;s spread to Europe were confirmed. The market;s slide and the political response in Washington played a role in the president;s decision to hold a press conference today, judging by the president;s own Twitter account.Low Ratings Fake News MSDNC (Comcast) &amp; @CNN are doing everything possible to make the Caronavirus look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible. Likewise their incompetent Do Nothing Democrat comrades are all talk, no action. USA in great shape! @CDCgov;..&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 26, 2020",https://tcrn.ch/2PswmEc
1950293,2020-02-26T15:44:41,"A look at Made Renovation, which just raised $9 million in seed funding to zero in on bathroom remodels","Made Renovation, a new, San Francisco-based company, thinks it has found a profitable way to help homeowners get done something that busy general contractors in the Bay Area won;t otherwise make time for, which is bathroom remodels.Why they typically pass on these: they have too many entire homes, or, at least, entire floors, to build for affluent regional homeowners who;ve kept the construction industry buzzing for years.It;s a problem that founders Roger Dickey,  who previously co-founded Gigster, and Sagar Shah, who previously founded Quad, think they can solve through technology, naturally. Their big idea: create bathroom templates whose scope and costs are generally understood, line up customers for them, then hire general contractors who are willing to focus only on these bathrooms.It;s an idea that;s picking up traction with these GCs, says Dickey, who explains it this way: ;General contractors generally see net margin of 3%; no matter the size of the job, owing to unforeseen hurdles, like pipes that suddenly need to be rebuilt, drains that need to be dug and materials that don;t ship on schedule.In addition to timing issues, GCs are also often dealing with frustrated building owners who might underestimate a project;s costs, particularly in California, where construction bills often cause sticker shock.Made Renovation sees an opportunity to make both the lives of GCs and homeowners easier. Through pre-negotiated pricing, volume and materials handling (it right now rents part of a warehouse where it receives goods), it;s promising GCs a ;reasonable margin; so they can not only pay their crews but live a higher quality of life themselves.Meanwhile, per the plan, customers need only choose from the company;s ;modern; collection, its more traditional ;heritage;design or its ;artisan; collection ; all of which can be customized ; then sit back while their long-neglected bathrooms are remade.Whether Made Renovation can pull off its grand vision is a giant question mark. The construction industry is nothing if not messy, and in addition to convincing GCs of its merits, Made Renovation ; like any marketplace company ; has to strike the right balance between customer demand and supply as it gets off the ground.In the meantime, investors clearly think it has promise. Led by Base10 Partners  and with participation from Felicis Ventures,  Founders Fund and some individual investors, the company has already raised $9 million in seed funding across two tranches.Part of that capital is on display right now in San Francisco, where Made Renovation today opened its doors to customers who want to check out its design ideas and, if all goes as planned, will begin lining up their own home improvement projects. Customers simply pick a collection, Made Renovation then puts together a ;mood board; of materials from that collection, sends out a 3D rendering of what to expect, then goes into build mode with its GC partners.As for what happens when that build goes awry, Dickey says Made Renovation has it covered. Most notably, while it guarantees the work to its own customers, the GCs with whom it works guarantee their work to Made Renovation.Dickey also notes that while the startup ;may lose money on some projects,; he stresses there are caveats that customers agree to at the outset. Among these, he says, ;We can;t X-ray their walls and see if they don;t have wiring up to code. We don;t cover dry rot in walls.; Technology, suggests Dickey, can only do so much.If you;re in the Bay Area and want to check out its new storefront, it;s on Chestnut Street in SF, in the city;s Marina district. The company hopes to perfect its model in the Bay Area, says Dickey, then expand into other regions. As for why Made Renovation decided to tackle one of the most challenging U.S. markets first, he suggests it;s the best way to test its mettle. ;I like the idea of starting a company here, because if we can make it work here, I think we can succeed anywhere.;",https://tcrn.ch/3cb2oyf

1948644,2020-02-26T12:29:32,ShapeMeasure;s smart tool and robotic cutter let contractors measure once and cut never,"As much as we;d all like to believe that our houses are built with perfectly square angles and other highly regular measurements, that;s rarely the case — which makes remodeling complex and tedious. ShapeMeasure hopes to alleviate that pain with a device that automatically measures a space and a robotic mill that cuts the required lumber precisely to size, shortening and easing the process by huge amounts.Founder Ben Blumer, who was exposed to the art of building and repair early by his father, a general contractor, had a brainwave that became the company during some renovations of his own.;I was shocked to see our flooring installer, who had 10 years of experience, and was excellent at what he did, take over an hour to install a single stair,; Blumer said. ;I started thinking, ;a little bit of technology could go a long way here.; ;Finding himself at the time free to work on such a project, he recruited a former general contractor friend and applied to HAX,  which soon shipped them off to Shenzhen to pursue their idea.						The main issue is stairs: they;re tricky, and especially in older homes can be pretty off-kilter. So although you know each stair is about 35 inches wide, it might be 35 and 3/64 inches, while the next one could be 34 and 61/64. Likewise, the angles might be ever so slightly off the 90 degrees or whatever they theoretically should be. Painstakingly measuring every single stair and manually cutting wood to those many slightly different dimensions is extremely time-consuming. The tool ShapeMeasure  built makes it literally a push-button affair.The device they settled on is essentially a super-precise lidar that measures around itself in wide arc, and the exact details of which comprise part of the company;s secret sauce. This gives the precise dimensions and attachment angles of the area around it, in the first intended use case a stair. The design, helped along by HAX;s Noel Joyce, looks a bit like a giant Dust Buster by way of the original ;Alien.;Obviously his shirt contradicts my headline, but if you think about the cutting as an automated process rather than something a person has to do, mine makes sense.;We were working with Noel Joyce, HAX;s lead industrial designer. We wanted a product that looked and felt like a tool. We figured, if you;re trying to convince contractors to try something new, it should feel familiar,; Blumer said. ;We spent hundreds of hours sourcing parts and re-engineering our scanning mechanism so that it could fit into Noel;s beautiful form factor. Turns out, contractors don;t care what it looks like. They liked the design, but were way more excited for the functionality.;Once the shapes are scanned in and checked, that information can be beamed off to ShapeMeasure;s other device, a robotic lumber sizing system that cuts wood into the exact size and shape necessary to fit together as stairs. Of course, the contractor still has to bring them to the location and attach them by whatever means they see fit, but what was once a process with perhaps hundreds of steps has been simplified by an order of magnitude.The machine is similar to other lumber-cutting devices, but simpler and easier to operate.;There are lots of automatic cutting systems ; often big, heavy, expensive and operated by professional CNC technicians. To cut flooring on a machine like that involves setting up jigs, clamping and reclamping each board, and generating custom gcode for each stair we cut,; Blumer said. They can be several times more costly and difficult to employ. ;The cutting solution we;re building is compact, requires no clamping, and can be operated with just a few hours of training.;It;s not just about length and width, either — molding and other flourishes on the stairs can make complex cuts necessary that would be impractical or at the very least extremely time-consuming to attempt manually.Examples of complex cuts made by the ShapeMeasure machine.The result is that the installation process from start to finish is about four times faster, they determined. If this seems a bit optimistic, know that it isn;t just armchair theorizing — they were careful to back up these numbers from the start.;We take our speedup data really seriously,; said Blumer. ;This is our top metric! One of the first purchases I made for the company was a dozen stopwatches. We;ve done installations in the ShapeMeasure lab and on real, messy construction sites — filming, timing and logging every moment.;Interestingly, the precut lumber made other improvements possible — the team designed a bucket to accommodate the increased rate at which the installer uses glue and other parts. It;s a bit like if you improved painting speed so much that your new bottleneck was mixing and pouring the paint into roller trays fast enough.Currently the company is working on establishing standard practices and packaging so that a ShapeMeasure ;microfactory; can be set up easily anywhere in the country on short notice. And they;re ;considering; raising money before then to accelerate the process. Blumer built the prototype with his own money and they pulled in a bit from HAX and then a small pre-seed round to get things started.With luck and a bit of elbow grease, ShapeMeasure could turn out to be a real differentiator in the contractor space — every hour counts, as does every dollar in an estimate.",https://tcrn.ch/2w4BYxI

Brooklyn-based Air is building a digital asset manager for communications teams that aren;t satisfied with more general cloud storage options and want something that can show off visual files with a bit more pizzazz.The startup tells TechCrunch that they have closed $6 million in funding led by Lerer Hippeau . RedSea Ventures, Advancit Capital and WndrCo also participated.General-purpose cloud storage options from Google or Dropbox don;t always handle digital assets well ; especially when it comes to previewing items, and Air;s more focused digital asset management competitors often require dedicated managers inside the org, the company says. Air has a pretty straightforward interface that looks more like a desktop site from Facebook or Pinterest, with a focus on thumbnails and video previews that;s simple and sleek.Air is trying to capitalize on the trend toward greater à la carte software spend for teams looking to phase in products with very specific toolsets. The team is generally charging $10 per user per month, with 100GB of storage included.;Adobe is an amazing suite of products, but with the idea that companies are mandating the tools that their employees use versus letting their employees choose ; it makes a lot of sense that teams are going to ultimately end up having more autonomy and creating better work when they;re using tools that they care about,; Lerer Hippeau managing partner Ben Lerer tells TechCrunch.Air lets customers migrate files from Dropbox or Google Drive to its AWS-hosted storage platform, which displays files like photos, videos, PDFs, fonts and other visual assets as Pinterest-esque boards. The app is a way to view and store files, but Air;s platform play focuses pretty heavily on giving co-workers the ability to comment and tag assets. Collaborating around files is a pretty easy sell; a couple of users discussing which photo they like best for a particular marketing campaign doesn;t require too much imagination.The team has been focusing largely on attracting users in roles like brand marketing managers, content coordinators and social media managers as a way of infiltrating and scaling vertically inside marketing departments.;What Airtable did to spreadsheets and what Notion did to docs, we;re doing for visual work,; CEO Shane Hegde told TechCrunch in an interview. ;As we think about how we differentiate, it;s really that we;re a workspace collaboration tool, we;re not just cloud storage or digital asset management;;",https://tcrn.ch/2wbhPpO
1951521,2020-02-26T12:00:42,"Chicago;s M1 Finance, a consumer-focused fintech platform, reaches $1B under management","Eagle-eyed readers will recall that we mentioned M1 Finance earlier today in our look at a few trends in the fintech industry. We;re back with the firm this afternoon as it has a bit of news that;s worth discussing.Chicago-based M1 Finance announced today that it has reached the $1 billion assets under management mark, or AUM. Reaching AUM thresholds provides useful milestones that we can use to track the progress of various players in the fintech and finservices worlds.M1 is an interesting company, bringing together a number of products to form a single platform. Its hybrid nature makes comparing its AUM to other companies; histories a bit dicey. Still, for reference, Wealthfront, a roboadvisor, announced that it started 2013 with AUM of $100 million, and closed that year with $538 million. By mid-2014, Wealthfront had $1 billion AUM. Today it has over $20 billion.So, the numbers matter, and reaching thresholds can help us understand where a company is in its maturity cycle.Let;s talk about M1 Finance;s  AUM growth, its revenue growth and its product model. It;s a neat company with a history of efficient growth.Growth, productWe;ll start with product, as how the company approaches its feature-set helps explain how the service is priced, which in turn helps us grok the company;s growth.M1 is not a roboadvisor, or a simple neobank, or a lending product; it;s all three at once, providing effectively the digital equivalent of a full-service bank, admittedly in the form of an online experience instead of a brick-and-mortar outlet. M1 users can open investment accounts, checking accounts, get a debit card and borrow money against their investment portfolios; it;s a cohesive feature set.Fintech CAC and the Great Credit Card CrazeAnd one that lets M1 price its products lower as a group than it could individually. During a call with M1;s CEO Brian Barnes about the company;s AUM milestone, the executive connected the company;s long-term vision to its ability to price aggressively. (All fintechs are expanding their platforms, it;s worth noting, meaning that, in time, nearly every fintech player will offer an array of services; Wealthfront, famous for its work in roboadvising, now also offers savings and borrowing capabilities.)Barnes said that M1 has long wanted to ;manage the bulk of [its users;] financial assets, not create a sort of low-friction acquisition hook; to bring in smaller-dollar accounts. This, in turn, means that M1 can have higher per-user sums on its books, which, it appears, helped the company reduce prices on a per-product basis.Here;s Barnes connecting per-account totals to pricing:Managing more of someone;s financial assets, and financial life, is going to be more economical. What it allows us to do is maintain lower margins per product, but have enough margin on the entire financial relationship that we can build a very sustainable durable, long-lasting business.That;s neat! And folks with lots of money expect low fees, especially in the Robinhood-era, so the setup probably helps with attracting users.RevenueSumming so far, M1 runs a broad set of financial products, attracting more dollars-per-user than other companies, perhaps, which lets it charge, in its view, lower prices.How low? Barnes told TechCrunch that his company is ;building [its] business model to make 1% of assets we manage [into] top line. So every billion bucks on the platform will be 10 million dollars in recurring revenue. And it is a relatively linear relationship.; The CEO later extended the point, saying that when his firm has $10 billion in AUM, it will generate $100 million.This means that as M1 scales, we;ll be able to know with reasonable confidence how much revenue it;s driving.The company charges in the manner you;d expect, with incomes from loaning money, interchange and a SaaS-product called M1 Plus that lowers some fees and provides interest on checking accounts, costing $125 yearly.Now that M1 is big enough to matter, it has to double, and then double again. We;ll know how well that;s going based on how quickly the company reaches the $2 billion mark.For investors, late-stage fintech startups are a lucrative bet",https://tcrn.ch/2Vnln2u
1951423,2020-02-26T11:02:40,Cartesiam helps developers bring AI to microcontrollers,"Cartesiam, a startup that aims to bring machine learning to edge devices powered by microcontrollers, has launched a new tool for developers who want an easier way to build services for these devices. The new NanoEdge AI Studio is the first IDE specifically designed for enabling machine learning and inferencing on Arm Cortex-M microcontrollers, which power billions of devices already.As Cartesiam  GM Marc Dupaquier, who co-founded the company in 2016, told me, the company works very closely with Arm, given that both have a vested interest in having developers create new features for these devices. He noted that while the first wave of IoT was all about sending data to the cloud, that has now shifted and most companies now want to limit the amount of data they send out and do a lot more on the device itself. And that;s pretty much one of the founding theses of Cartesiam. ;It;s just absurd to send all this data ; which, by the way, also exposes the device from a security standpoint,; he said. ;What if we could do it much closer to the device itself?;The company first bet on Intel;s short-lived Curie SoC platform. That obviously didn;t work out all that well, given that Intel  axed support for Curie in 2017. Since then, Cartesiam has focused on the Cortex-M platform, which worked out for the better, given how ubiquitous it has become. Since we;re talking about low-powered microcontrollers, though, it;s worth noting that we;re not talking about face recognition or natural language understanding here. Instead, using machine learning on these devices is more about making objects a little bit smarter and, especially in an industrial use case, detecting abnormalities or figuring out when it;s time to do preventive maintenance.Today, Cartesiam already works with many large corporations that build Cortex-M-based devices. The NanoEdge Studio makes this development work far easier, though. ;Developing a smart object must be simple, rapid and affordable ; and today, it is not, so we are trying to change it,; said Dupaquier. But the company isn;t trying to pitch its product to data scientists, he stressed. ;Our target is not the data scientists. We are actually not smart enough for that. But we are unbelievably smart for the embedded designer. We will resolve 99% of their problems.; He argues that Cartesiam reduced time to market by a factor of 20 to 50, ;because you can get your solution running in days, not in multiple years.;One nifty feature of the NanoEdge Studio is that it automatically tries to find the best algorithm for a given combination of sensors and use cases and the libraries it generates are extremely small and use somewhere between 4K to 16K of RAM.NanoEdge Studio for both Windows and Linux is now generally available. Pricing starts at €690/month for a single user or €2,490/month for teams.",https://tcrn.ch/2VqLu90

A formal announcement is slated for Friday or next week.Tagomi offers a platform that helps large traders and funds easily access cryptocurrency markets. The news comes days after Libra added Shopify, a reversal of dwindling membership after major partners like Visa, PayPal and Stripe dropped out late last year.We;ve reached out to the Libra Association and have been promised a response by Facebook;s communications team.[Update 2/27/2020 3:30pm pacific: Libra now confirms our report that Tagomi is joining the Libra Association. “We are excited to welcome Tagomi to the Libra Association. Tagomi joins a growing group of Libra Association members committed to achieving a safe, transparent, and consumer-friendly implementation of a global payment system that breaks down financial barriers for billions of people” says Libra’s head of policy and communications Dante Disparte.]Joining Libra means Tagomi will be expected to contribute at least $10 million toward developing the cryptocurrency, with that investment eligible to reap dividends from interest earned on money kept in the Libra Reserve. Tagomi will also operate a node that validates transactions coming through the Libra blockchain.Tagomi was founded by Jennifer Campbell, a former investor at Union Square Ventures, which is also a Libra Association Member. The company has 25 employees across five offices. Tagomi will be the 22nd member of the Libra Association, according to information from the startup;s press representative, who was apparently supposed to hold this news until later. ;Tagomi is joining the Libra Foundation and Jennifer will be the newest member,; they emailed TechCrunch.Campbell and Tagomi will offer technical and policy support to Libra in an effort to make the cryptocurrency more safe and compliant with international law. That will be critical for the Libra Association to get the green light from regulators for a launch in 2020 like it originally planned. Lawmakers in the U.S. and EU have slammed Libra in hearings and the press over its potential to facilitate money laundering, harm privacy and destabilize the global financial system.Campbell says that her company’s legal expertise, which led to its navigating red tape to become New York;s first licensed agency brokerage for virtual currencies, could be especially helpful to the Libra Association. When asked about how the company could get Libra approved for launch, Campbell told me ;It;s just a grind working with each of the regulatory bodies . . . I think it just takes some time to help educate people to understand what the mission is and what our strategy and technology looks alike and what safeguards we;ll be putting in place for KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering).;Campbell believes Libra will eventually get the go-ahead. ;We feel very confident that we;ll end up with a solution that gives regulatory confidence that we;ll be able to execute in a very safe and regulated manner before we build out this payment system.;The full membership of the Libra Association is now:Current Members:Facebook’s  Calibra, Tagomi, Shopify, PayU, Farfetch, Lyft, Spotify, Uber, Illiad SA, Anchorage, Bison Trails, Coinbase, Xapo, Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures, Breakthrough Initiatives, Ribbit Capital, Thrive Capital, Creative Destruction Lab, Kiva, Mercy Corps, Women’s World Banking.Former Members:Vodafone, Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, PayPal, Mercado Pago, Bookings Holdings, eBay.Shopify joins Facebook;s cryptocurrency Libra Association",https://tcrn.ch/2w7HjUO
1950785,2020-02-26T10:29:45,Andreessen makes Ribbon Health the first investment from its $750 million new healthcare fund,"One of the biggest roadblocks to reducing costs in the American healthcare system is the system;s inherent lack of transparency.Most healthcare networks and hospital systems can;t even accurately account for the doctors they manage and which insurance plans those doctors accept ; let alone how good those doctors actually are at providing care, according to Ribbon Health chief executive Nate Maslak.The former healthcare consultant founded Ribbon Health to address just that issue, and the company has raised $10.25 million in new financing to roll out its software services to a broader network of payers, providers and digital health companies.The new financing was led by Andreessen Horowitz, and included Y Combinator and the New York-based investment firm BoxGroup. Individual healthcare executives like Nat Turner, the chief executive of Flatiron Health; Vivek Garipalli, chief executive and co-founder of Clover Health; and Eric Roza, the former chief executive of DataLogix, also participated in the financing.It;s the first deal for Andreessen;s newest healthcare-focused partner, Julie Yoo,  and is in an area with which Yoo is quite familiar. The former serial healthcare entrepreneur developed a similar business to tackle better data collection and delivery for hospitals at Kyruus.Taking an API -based approach, Ribbon Health is building on the Kyruus approach, Yoo said, with the potential to expand across the entire breadth of the American healthcare system.Simply, Ribbon Health is trying to create an accurate database of what doctors and health plans have, which specializations offer their services to which insurance providers, and produce the best outcomes for patients.;$700 billion wasted because of poor decisions,; said Maslak. ;The information not flowing to the right place at the right time. Over a third of healthcare spending is wasted and we think that over half is data-addressable.;“The majority of decisions in health care rely on data about a provider or health plan, yet our industry lacks the systematic infrastructure to centralize this information and contextualize it for those who need it. There is a clear need for a single platform that can provide comprehensive, up-to-date data to enable informed decision making across health care, and we believe Ribbon is poised to lead in this space,” said Yoo, in a statement.Along with the new financing, Ribbon also unveiled a tool that provides cost and quality information for patients to understand their potential out-of-pocket cost estimates based on their deductible, plan design and provider prices.“So much of the innovation in health care relies on accurate data. Our goal is to provide these companies the critical data infrastructure needed to improve quality of care, health outcomes, and control costs,” said Nate Fox, co-founder and chief technology officer at Ribbon Health, in a statement. “Our platform and seamless API make it easy for customers to trust us to deliver the most comprehensive, accurate data, allowing them to focus on what they do best on the front lines of health care.”The company is already working with Oak Street Health and Well (Well Dot, Inc.), and will use the additional funding to expand its sales and marketing efforts and increase adoption.;Provider data is a basic building block of every healthcare transaction,; said Yoo. ;Whether it’s you or I trying to enroll… or referral claim processing… there are tens of billions of transactions, all of which require information about a provider.;",https://tcrn.ch/39dGV65
1950452,2020-02-26T10:00:27,YC just published a 70-page Series A guide so founders don;t tank their own prospects,"This morning, Y Combinator  is publishing a 70-page Series A guide based on its work with 190 YC companies over the last couple of years. It;s part of an initiative launched in 2018 to help these alums understand how Series A rounds work ; and how to make them work to their advantage.The program is led by YC partner Aaron Harris, with whom we talked at the program;s launch and who we caught up with again earlier this week to find out what;s in the guide, and why ; given the many related posts that YC publishes on a regular basis ; the outfit felt the need to put something so massive together. Excerpts from that chat follow.TC: You;ve been working expressly with companies on their Series A rounds for a couple of years. What are some of the misconceptions around how to land these financings?AH: I had this idea that Series A rounds were understood on the investor side ; that they are looking for ARR, plus profit, then comes funding. But the metrics that people like to talk about, they;re really meaningless. We;ve seen companies funded with $200,000 in ARR and companies funded with $9 million in ARR. It;s really fundamentally a bet on what the investor thinks the future looks like based on the founder and what the business is doing at that point. It;s entirely possible to raise on a great story and no metrics, versus great metrics and no story.TC: If you don;t need to reach a certain financial threshold, then how do you know when it;s time to reach out to Series A investors?AH: There;s a lot of preparation required [before doing this]; we advise against companies going out to market because of a false signal. Sometimes, an investor wants to give a team a term sheet and they misinterpret this interest and kick off the fundraising process before they;re ready.TC: How many investors do founders have to meet with on average?AH: They meet with 30 on average to produce a single term sheet.TC: Are these preemptive offers then good news?AH: They aren;t as good as they seem. If an investor preempts your round, you might think you;ve won. But looking at dozens of preemptive rounds versus non-preemptive rounds, we;ve seen that companies wind up giving up 1.4% more in dilution for nearly $1 million less in funding when they do this, and that;s quite a lot of your company. Also, if people want to preempt you, there;s a good chance others will like your company.TC: This guide is very detailed. For TC readers wondering what they;ll find in it, what;s one example of the advice it includes?AH: We explain how to work through a diligence request by an investor. Someone might say, ;Hey, can you give me a month-by-month breakdown of major customers?; And we;ve seen founders give them a full list of their customers, then the VC calls them, and if the customer is having a bad day or [the VC] reaches the wrong person, that bad reference check can sink a round. It;s really important that founders ask instead about what the VC is trying to learn from the diligence request, then call those customers so they;re ready, You also want to make sure that 15 investors aren;t calling the same customer so that [that person or company] isn;t overwhelmed.TC: Why make your findings available to everyone if you;re trying to give YC companies an edge?AH: We;re happy we;ve helped our companies do better at raising A rounds, but we want to help as many founders as we possibly can. It goes back to [Paul Graham;s] online essays for founders to our Startup School, through which we;re helping founders all over the world at no cost. This guide is another step designed to solve that information asymmetry between what founders and investors know.If YC can help companies build bigger companies and level the playing field, that;s just overall good for the rate of innovation in the world.TC: A lot of this advice assumes that the economy won;t change. It;s based on two years of findings in a market where things have been clicking along nicely. Have you considered the impact of this coronavirus slowing things down ; including the money flow to the Bay Area ; and making it harder for startups to get funded?AH: I don;t think startups are killed by macro trends, unlike tech giants; they;re too small. [PitchBook recently estimated] that there is $100 billion in dry powder [waiting to be invested in startups], but that sounds way too low to me. In 2007, 2008, I was at Bridgewater Associates, and we saw the amount of money sitting on the sidelines in sovereign wealth funds, and various of these have trillions of dollars. And some are investing directly in startups.",https://tcrn.ch/2wKqorD

1950900,2020-02-26T08:00:32,Strattic raises $6.5M to bring static WordPress to the masses,"WordPress  remains the juggernaut of content management systems, even though it now often gets used in ways it was never intended. And with that, managing the life cycle of WordPress sites has only gotten more complicated, too, all while hackers are trying to exploit any and all security issues to take control of a site. Strattic aims to make all of this a lot easier by turning WordPress sites into static sites that don;t query a database whenever a user looks at a page.The Israeli company today announced that it has raised a $6.5 million seed round led by SignalFire  and TenOneTen Ventures,  with participation from Accel,  Automattic, Seneca VC, Eric Ries and Village Global VC. It also announced that Zeev Suraski, who co-created PHP  3 and the Zend Engine that;s at the core of PHP 4, has joined the company as its CTO.About 13 years ago, Strattic  CEO and co-founder Miriam Schwab founded a WordPress web development company. At that time, WordPress was often still seen as a tool for running personal blogs, but that has obviously changed over time. But she realized that once her agency handed off the site to the customer, they would often come back to her to ask for maintenance as well ; and the idea behind Strattic is based on that experience and trying to simplify that process by using static site generators. Schwab noted that those aren;t necessarily all that user-friendly, though.;WordPress is still the best option out there, but it has these major issues, so I thought, all right, why not marry these two worlds? WordPress stays WordPress, but maybe we turn it into a static site generator. And that was the initial concept for Strattic,; Schwab told me.;It was just such an obviously good idea,; co-founder and COO Josh Lawrence added. ;It means that you don;t need to do maintenance anymore. It means that your site is 99.99999% more unhackable than before. It;s going to be faster, no matter what. Totally scalable. It;s just all these things and as long as you can make it work ; which was not simple ; it;s just obvious from a business perspective.;With Strattic, users still get the usual WordPress experience, but the company only spins up a WordPress container when you are using it, which significantly reduces the attack surface, and then generates the static sites as you make changes. Those static sites obviously load very fast and also provide a smaller attack surface. To speed up the sites, Strattic also uses AWS;s CDN solution.Lawrence, however, also told me, that getting funding wasn;t easy at first. VCs in Israel weren;t really looking to fund a WordPress company at the time, even though Strattic was growing (mostly organically) at a very nice pace and getting real customers. So in order to raise this round, the company went to Silicon Valley, looking to raise $2 million but came back with $6.5 million in an oversubscribed round.The team plans to use the new funding to build out its product team and start rolling out new features quickly. Currently, for example, there are still a few types of sites that don;t work with Strattic, including those that use the popular WooCommerce system, because they rely on database connections. Support for these types of sites is in the works, though.",https://tcrn.ch/3c8JO9W

A number of angel investors also participated in the round. The company has raised a total of approximately $11.5 million.GraphQL is an open-source tool originally developed at Facebook in 2012 and open-sourced a few years later. Hasura  CEO and co-founder Tanmai Gopal says the company had been working on helping developers to simplify Kubernetes, but over time, it realized that data access was a bigger problem, so it developed an open-source tool that works with GraphQL to help solve that issue.;Application developers need access to data sitting in databases. So Hasura is an open-source service that lets you find your databases, set up a little bit of configuration, and then you generate a GraphQL API that;s performant and secure,; Gopal told TechCrunch.The net result is a kind of Data as a Service API that has solved a big problem for GraphQL users, especially the back-end developers, who had to spend lots of time manually connecting the application to the data sources for front-end developers working with GraphQL. This service creates some code that the front-end developers can drop into their application and connect to the database without a fuss.It has proven popular, with more than 29 million downloads and counting. The company hopes to make money with an enterprise version that is currently in testing and should be ready soon.For now, the San Francisco-based company has 40 employees, a number that should rise over the next year with the new funding.

It;s a 42-inch tall screen with 3D machine vision that tracks and teaches you as you workout. The giant upright HD display makes it feel like your personal trainer is right there with you while you compete with others in live and on-demand classes.Tempo;s Microsoft Kinect-esque motion sensors scan you 30 times per second and notify you if your form is wrong. It;s all housed in a sleekly designed free-standing cabinet that neatly stores the included barbells, dumbbells, attachable weights, workout mat, recovery foam roller, and heartrate monitor.Tempo opens for pre-orders today for $1995, requiring a $250 deposit and $39 monthly content subscription before shipping this summer.;Every single product in the market took a piece of equipment out of a gym and slapped a screen on it; says Tempo CEO and co-founder Moawia Eldeeb. ;You need to be able to see a user to actually be able to give them guidance so they can work out safely. We wanted to build a fitness experience from the ground up with training and form feedback at the core of it.;I demo;d Tempo this week and found the in-home convenience, motivational on-screen personal trainers, and the real-time posture corrections gave me the confidence to lift weights without the fear of injury. It might not feel quite as fun and addictive as Peloton,  but it offers a facsimile of personal training that;s more affordable than in-person classes that cost $100 or more.The idea of democratizing access to trainers is what convinced Eldeeb and the Tempo team to stretch its initial $1.8 million in seed funding for four years. While collecting data from its SmartSpot in-gym weight lifting assessment device, Tempo survived long enough to build this prototype.;Most investors had given up on us. We built this product and had just $700,000 left; Eldeeb recalls. But once people could try Tempo, ;we pitched 10 investors and got 9 term sheets. It got very competitive.; The startup recently walked away with a $17.5 million Series A round from Founders Fund, DCM, and Khosla Ventures. Now Tempo will pour that cash into marketing, retail distribution, R&amp;D, and content production.A founder’s journey out of homelessnessTempo;s mission is to change people;s lives for the better like personal training did for Eldeeb. ;Training is what took me out of a homeless shelter and got me to where I am I today; he reflects.Tempo co-founder, CEO, and CPO Moawia EldeebEldeeb’s family immigrated to the US from Egypt when he was nine. But after an explosion leveled their building, they wound up in a homeless shelter. Eldeeb eventually dropped out of middle school to work in a pizza parlor and help pay the bills. But personal trainers at a local YMCA took him under their wing. He eventually paid his way through a computer science degree at Columbia University by working as a personal trainer to his eventual co-founder and CTO Josh Augustin. ;Having trainers say you;re getting stronger taught me I could do something for myself.;While at school, Eldeeb was developing an idea for a physical therapy wearable while Augustin was building 3D sensors for guiding robot perception. They soon realized that a combination of these ideas ;offered us the possibility to deliver on the promise of guiding your form and tracking your progress accurately.;In 2015, they started a company called Pivot  to build SmartSpot ; a similar looking upright screen that was designed for gyms. It could track users, but only output raw data about their form, like how bent a user;s knees were during a squat. It then worked with trainers to annotate the data to determine what movement patterns were safe and which were dangerous.Gym owners bought in because it let them track which trainers were actually helping customers improve. ;It held trainers accountable. If you weren;t delivering results, it;d be obvious; Eldeeb tells me. The company built up a dataset of over from over 1 million 3D tagged workouts, from hundreds of gyms, overseen by thousands of trainers. That formed the basis of the artificial intelligence that would let Pivot pivot into Tempo.Pumping Iron With TempoAt first, Tempo;s giant screen and black or white armoire can feel a bit daunting. The thing is about six feet tall, though it only takes up as much room as a large chair. It makes efficient use of space, with the barbell and dumbbells racked on the back, an internal shelf for the foam roller and mat, and a soft-closing cabinet on the front with the rubber-coated weight set. Keeping everything together means you won;t have to go digging in your closet to start a work out.Tempo walks users through an initial computer-vision fitness assessment to understand your strength and flexibility so it can set base levels for its exercises. If you have an injury it needs to nurse, Tempo connects you to a human personal trainer that helps customize your workout plan. Otherwise, it uses your goals and data to set out a progressive regimen that gets a little tougher each day. It even blocks you from jumping into later classes so you don;t strain yourself.Your workout plan begins with tutorial sessions that teach you to do the exercises with safe and proper form. When I was hunching forward during my squats, Tempo;s computer vision would ding me with instant feedback to keep my knees back and chest up. Then once I;d corrected the issue, it congratulated me with little green checkmarks. ;Any product that doesn;t offer that is no better than a DVD or YouTube videos; Eldeeb remarks.From there I could choose between a variety of class styles and lengths, ranging from high intensity interval training circuits to isolated sessions focused on particular muscle groups. In each, you watch a near life-size personal trainer doing the routines right in front of you while they demonstrate form and drop inspirational quotes.Tempo is producing seven live classes per day from its San Francisco studio which you can also watch on-demand. You can compete against friends or strangers, and Tempo compares you rep for rep so it;s more about perfect form than reckless speed or weight. The live trainers can actually see all your data and your mistakes on a dashboard as they lead classes, and can call you out for screwing up (though you can deactivate this shame mode). Eldeeb says ;knowing the trainer can possibly see your numbers will motivate you to actually do this right.;The class selection interface is suspiciously similar to Peloton;s, though that at least will make it familiar for some. Over time, you build up an immense collection of data on your performance in each work out, excercise, and muscle. Unlike hitting the gym by yourself, you;ll never struggle to remember how much weight to use or whether you;re improving. Classes are soundtracked with dancey remixes sourced from a partnership with Feed.fm to avoid the royalty issues with original songs that slapped Peloton.Tempo gives feedback when you;re doing exercises wrong, and when you correct yourselfFor a 14-person startup, Tempo is trying to do a ton and that can leave some rough edges. The bluetooth armband heartrate monitor can have connectivity issues and the computer vision doesn;t always register every rep, especially if your posture is off. Classes also fail to include enough stretching to prevent strains, instead devoting the start of classes to warmups that ease you in but might not protect your muscles well enough. My quads were destroyed after my demo.Tempo still achieves its primary objective: it makes weight lifting accessible. No need to drag yourself to the gym or be beholden to a trainer;s schedule, where I;d always end up arriving late and wasting 25% of my session. The form feedback fixes my core complaint about remote personal training app Future I;ve been using for nine months, which can;t see you. That;s led to minor injuries from bad sit-up posture and other incorrect movements. Tempo can;t catch everything, but it can nip some of the most common mistakes in the bud.Eldeeb was blunt when asked why Tempo is better than well-funded competitors like $3000 Tonal;s wall-mounted resistance cable-based training system or the $1500 Mirror;s massive screen.;The biggest problem with Tonal  is two-fold. Cables and motors do not last. I want this product to be in your house for 10-plus years. [Tempo] is in gyms running 24/7 in for 3 years and it;s still working. The second biggest thing is just feedback.; While Tonal does include a camera and microphone it might employ in the future, it;s not scanning you to detect when you;re lifting weights crooked like Tempo.As for Mirror, ;What is the difference between ClassPass Live and Mirror? It doesn;t come with any equipment, and there;s no training. It;s just a two-way mirror and a Samsung LED panel behind it with an arduino board; Eldeeb rails. He claims it can;t actually monitor your workouts and that his team;s tests found Mirror would say they;d burned 500 calories when they were literally just sitting on their couch in front of it.Eldeeb demos TempoIf the software proves to have high retention so people actually recommend Tempo to friends, the biggest hurdle will be its price. You can buy a couple dumbbells for $50 or get a barbell weight bench for a few hundred. Even if Tempo;s $55 per month financing option plus $39 subscription makes it cheaper than a single personal training session or on-par with a gym membership, it could still seem like a serious commitment.That feeling is magnified by how all of its equipment and classes and data can feel a bit overwhelming. The startup might have to spend a fortune on retail establishments that can guide users through their first Tempo experience. There;s also no mobile version yet, so you can;t bring the work outs on the road with you.Eldeeb seems guinely motivated to keep improving the product so it;s better than commuting to work out. ;Getting to the gym or class is often half the battle. By bringing the gym to you and structuring the classes to be as efficient as possible, Tempo not only makes improving your health more convenient, but it gives you back your most precious resource: time.;For those comfortable lifting the cheap weights they have at home or hitting up a budget gym, Tempo might seem needlessly overwrought and expensive. But for anyone who needs more instruction or wants to get a Barry;s Bootcamp-worthy workout at home, Tempo might be just their speed.",https://tcrn.ch/2T2GOnS
1951290,2020-02-26T06:49:48,Indonesian entertainment development company Visinema raises $3.25 million Series A,"Jakarta-based entertainment company Visinema will build its animation business and expand into more Southeast Asian markets after raising a $3.25 million Series A led by Intudo Ventures. Returning investors GDP Ventures and Ancora Capital also participated.Founded in June 2008 by CEO Angga Dwimas Sasongko, a director and producer, Visinema produces TV shows, feature films, commercials and other content. Its end-to-end operations allow it to control almost every part of content creation, from concept to distribution and monetization. Visinema’s clients have included Unilever, Toyota and Honda. Along with a seed round from GDP Ventures, its Series A brings Visinema’s total raised so far to $5.25 million.The company will use its funding to grow its animation production by partnering with or acquiring Indonesian animation studios, with plans to release its first animated feature film this year. Called Nussa, the movie began as characters developed for YouTube. Its other segments include Visinema Pictures for theatrical releases; Visinema Content, which creates shows for streaming platforms like Netflix, iFlix and Gojek’s GoPlay; and Visinema Campus, its talent development program.Chief of business development and partnerships Ajeng Parameswari says Indonesia’s film industry contributed about $69 billion to its economy in 2015, with 7% year-over-year growth; locally produced movies account for about 40% of movies circulating in the country, a number expected to increase 55% this year.This gives Visinema room to grow in terms of both theatrical releases and content created for streaming platforms, including international services that are launching in Indonesia, like Amazon Prime, Disney+ and Catchplay.;The landscape is changing fast, as the Indonesian government eases restriction on outside investment in the movie business,; she told TechCrunch.In a press statement, Intudo Ventures  founding partner Patrick Yip said, ;Indonesia’s domestic film industry has experienced rapid growth over the past few years, both in terms of feature-length films and unique content formats, and there continues to be significant demand for high-grade local content. With in-house produced Hollywood-caliber content, we believe that Visinema is well-positioned to tell more Indonesian stories to audiences both domestically and around the world.;",https://tcrn.ch/37WdXpG

The company’s tools are used by customers like Lyft, Airbnb, Salesforce, Box and Duke University.The former startup went public in 2016 at $15 a share. Yesterday Twilio’s stock closed at $113.90, giving the company a market cap of about $15.6 billion (after a horrendous week on Wall Street). It’s easy to look at its value (among other measures) and declare Twilio  a successful public company. But just like every former startup out there, its ascent wasn’t always so certain.Founded in 2008, Twilio was once a tentative early-stage company feeling its way forward in the market with an unproven product and more future potential than actual results. Recently, the company’s CEO Jeff Lawson  shared a Twilio board deck from March 2010.Naturally, we read through it — how could we not? — but we also decided to analyze it for you, pulling out what we learned and using the snapshot of Twilio’s history to illustrate how far the company has come in the last decade.The presentation’s original time stamp lands after Twilio’s Series A and just before its Series B, allowing us to see a company molting from a hatchling to something more sturdy that could stand on its own two feet. The company raised $12 million six months after the deck was presented.To get everyone on the same page, we’ll start with a little history, and then get into the deck itself.

More than 4 million sites have already been built with the tool ; and it;s now seeing a million new sites every six months.Now the Tel Aviv-based company, which was founded in 2016, has raised its first round of institutional funding ; a $15 million round from Lightspeed Venture Partners .;Elementor;s  growth is a wonderful example of the power of community and open-source software,; said Tal Morgenstern, partner at Lightspeed. ;The founders set out to solve their own problems as web professionals and ended up with a global, highly involved fan base that kept pushing and shaping the product from the very onset.

1950842,2020-02-26T03:00:03,Alkymi launches with $5M seed to automate email data extraction,"Alkymi, an early-stage startup that wants to bring intelligence to highly manual business processes like copying and pasting financial data from emails and attachments, launched today with a $5 million seed investment.Canaan Partners  led the round with participation from previous investor Work-Bench. SimCorp also contributed as a strategic investor. Under the terms of the investment agreement, Joydeep Bhattacharyya from Canaan will become a member of the Alkymi  board.Company founder and CEO Harald Collet says the startup is bringing machine learning to the business analyst;s in-box with the goal of automating many of the tedious manual parts of the job. The company has created a solution that extracts data automatically that these analysts previously had to copy and paste into applications, spreadsheets or databases.;What we do is we focus on automating tasks in emails and documents and really focus on helping business analysts in [automating] those tasks where they have been taking and picking out of business data customer and financial data that;s being fed into business processes,; Collet told TechCrunch.For today, that strictly involves financial services, which is an industry Collet has worked in for two decades, and which could benefit greatly from this approach. He uses an investment asset manager as an example. This person would receive emails with data in them about investments, copy and paste the data into an application or database, and repeat this many times to report on overall investment performance. Alkymi would automatically extract some amount of this data, reducing the overall manual copying and pasting required.GIF: AlkymiIt takes some time to train the underlying machine model, from hours to days, depending on the size and complexity of the operation, but once that;s done, Collet says the software can deal with what it knows, setting aside what it can;t figure out for a human to intervene, and then learn from that in a typical machine learning loop. Over time, it should allow business analysts to do more analysis, instead of spending time on data entry to get to the analysis part. For now, they are looking at rates starting at 40-50% automation, or more for less complex data sets.While the company is concentrating on financial services today, the long-term plan is to expand into other verticals over time. For now, it is growing quickly with paying financial services customers. It has also partnered with investor SimCorp, which will offer the service on its platform aimed at financial services professionals.The company launched in 2017, and Collet spent time talking to potential customers before building the product. It offers an on-prem and cloud version, and bills by the workflow. It has seven employees based in New York City, with plans to double that this year.",https://tcrn.ch/392cHCO

And it has acquired assets from Coup, a now-defunct scooter service, the moped kind. Coup  shut down late last year, and Tier Mobility plans to take over and start its own shared moped service.To be clear, Coup is over, but its mopeds will stick around. As part of the deal, Tier Mobility now has around 5,000 mopeds and a charging infrastructure. It plans to launch its own moped service in Berlin in May. Both the scooter and moped services will be accessible from the main Tier app.Coup had a partnership with Gogoro, a Taiwanese electric vehicle company. You can expect to be able to access the same mopeds but with a fresh coat of paint.“We have gained valuable experience with e-scooters and can now use this effectively in the field of e-mopeds. Many customers want a slightly faster vehicle for medium distances of 4 to 10 kilometres. Now we can now offer these people a very good deal with high-quality vehicles,” Tier Mobility co-founder and CEO Lawrence Leuschner said in a statement.Before shutting down, Coup was operating in Berlin, Paris and Madrid. It’s unclear whether Tier Mobility wants to launch a moped service in those cities as well.Tier Mobility currently operates in 55 cities across 11 countries. It is currently focused on Europe. The company is based in Berlin.It’s going to be interesting to see how Tier Mobility charges its customers for the moped service. Unit economics have been the main issue with Coup.“Even though Coup is a well-known brand in this market with a loyal customer base that regularly uses our services, operating Coup in the long term has become economically unsustainable,” Coup said when it shut down.",https://tcrn.ch/2wO6eND

1951079,2020-02-25T22:49:27,"Minute Media raises $40M more for its user-generated, syndication-based sports publishing platform","When it comes to the internet, content may be king, but in many cases, the emperor has no clothes. That is to say, the masses may click on interesting stories, video, music and other media, but building a lucrative business around that content can be a struggle, with advertising-based models often providing little in the way of margins except for the very biggest properties (and even then, it can a tough balancing act managing costs).A startup called Minute Media believes that it has found a way through that challenge with a platform that brings in user-generated content across a number of its own mostly-sports-based media properties ; built organically and by way of acquisition ; which it then syndicates to third-party publishing partners.Today, the startup is announcing a $40 million round to continue its growth ; specifically to continue investing in its publishing platform; to invest in properties that it already owns; and to make more acquisitions.Led by London;s Dawn Capital (Minute Media  describes itself as based in New York, but its founding team are out of Israel and it grew initially in London, where its CEO current lives) with participation from other unnamed previous investors (a list that includes Battery Ventures, Goldman Sachs, ProSieben, Qumra Capital, Vintage Investments, Gemini Ventures, North Base Media, La Maison, Remagine Ventures, Hamilton Lane and Maor Investments) the funding brings the total raised by Minute Media to $160 million.The startup is not disclosing its valuation, but last year we understood from a source very close to the company to be between $200 million and $300 million. Given that it grew around 100% last year, and currently is on track for revenues this year of $200 million, that likely puts the current valuation closer to $400-$500 million.On the shoulders of giantsMinute Media may not be a name you know very well, but if you are a consumer of sports content online, you may have come across some of its properties or articles. Its holdings currently number seven titles and include names like 90min.com (which focuses on soccer, hence the name: the startup;s founder and CEO Asaf Peled is a football fanatic), as well as FanSided, The Players; Tribune and Mental Floss. (Others include 12up, DBLTAP and The Big Lead.)Some of these Minute Media built from scratch, but many have come to it courtesy of the bigger picture of the media industry today: titles are created, gain an audience and brand recognition, and then get passed around in the world of online publishing when the previous owner has not been able to make the business case for the site work.For example, FanSided came to Minute Media by way of an acquisition just last month: Meredith sold it, reportedly for $15 million, as part of a larger divestment of ;non-core; assets it has been making post its Owen acquisition of Time, Inc. in 2018 (FanSided once sat under Sports Illustrated).The Players Tribune, meanwhile, runs stories written by athletes themselves ; some extremely timely, such as this one from Sabrina Ionescu, a rising star in women;s basketball, published just on Monday, in the same week that her name has been making waves because of her speech at the Bryant memorial service, plus her heroic work on the court. The site was founded by baseball legend Derek Jeter, and raised some money from big names, but ultimately couldn;t last as an independent startup. It sold in November last year to Minute Media.And Mental Floss, something of a cult click-bait title (at one point even Monica thumbed through a printed version at Central Perk), lost its way after Facebook algorithm changes. Now its home is also at Minute Media.On the surface, this might look mainly like an aggregator media play, or on an M&amp;A level something based on the private equity model of hoovering up a lot of tired or slow growing brands with the aim of optimising them and moving on.But neither is actually accurate. As Peled describes it (and as VCs apparently believe), there is a technology story, and corresponding interesting business model, underpinning what Minute Media has built that spans, B2C, B2B and C2C publishing and distribution.For starters, there is the centralised content management system that runs the sites, ;an open CMS system that allows any casual fan to create rich content,; Peled told TechCrunch.While this has had as many as 20,000 contributors on it at one time, contributing articles in a variety of languages beyond English, the number of pieces ; selected by human editors ; published across all its platforms is less than 1,000 per day. Only the most prolific and longstanding contributors get paid; others contribute for free. This forms the basis of the company;s content engine.That content brings in traffic and advertising on Minute Media;s owned properties, but this is only one piece of how the company makes money. That same platform is also a licensing-based B2B and B2C play: it links up to about a dozen or more other publishers and media partners, which use it both to syndicate content out and bring in content from other places. The logic here is that bringing in syndicated content from elsewhere can help the other publishers bring down their operating costs while still continuing to expand the content (and thus traffic) on their own sites; hence why they partner with (and pay) Minute Media.Last summer, Peled told me that the balance between ad and licensing revenues were ;around 50/50, but no doubt the B2B open platform is easier to sell and is growing faster.;Sport winsAlthough there is other content beyond sports on Minute Media;s platform, sports is a key focus, and for good reason.Sports content has shaped up to be an extremely important segment in the world of online media. Done right, it can breed a legion of engaged and very loyal visitors ; readers, viewers, listeners ; who are willing to do more than just click once and move on. If they like what they see, they will come back again, and again. That has helped some of the more interesting sports properties build paid content models ; see The Athletic ; and others spin out media empires based on still-evolving mediums like podcasting ; see the huge success of The Ringer and its recent sale to Spotify.Minute Media fits into that bigger picture with its own take on how to build and scale a sports publishing empire. Without some of the overhead that has weighed down other online publishing plays, the startup has built a concept for publishing that appears to have a kind of sustainability to it.;Minute Media;s best-in-class platform enables publishers to create, distribute and monetize high-quality content,; said Haakon Overli, general partner at Dawn Capital, in a statement. ;The company is quickly establishing itself as a major player in the new generation of online publishing, empowering creators and audiences alike. Following explosive revenue growth in 2019, we;re pleased to back the team once again, allowing them to accelerate R&amp;D and commercial efforts further still.;",https://tcrn.ch/2T0JZfY
1951242,2020-02-25T22:12:18,On-demand tutoring app Snapask gets $35 million to expand in Southeast Asia,"Snapask, an on-demand tutoring app, announced today that it has raised $35 million in Series B funding. Earmarked for the startup’s expansion in Southeast Asia, the round was led by Asia Partners and Intervest.Launched in Hong Kong five years ago, Snapask  has now raised a total of $50 million and operates in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Japan and South Korea. Its other investors have included Kejora Ventures, Ondine Capital and SOSV Chinaccelerator (Snapask participated in its accelerator program).Founder and CEO Timothy Yu said Snapask will expand into Vietnam and focus on markets in Southeast Asia where there is a high demand for tutoring and other private education services. It will also open a regional headquarter in Singapore and develop video content and analytics products for its platform.The company now has a total of 3 million students, with 1.3 million who registered over the past twelve months (including a recent surge that Yu attributes to students studying at home after COVID-19 related school cancellations). Over the past year, 100,000 tutors have applied, taking Snapask’s current total to 350,000 applicants.Yu says that over 2 million questions are asked by students each month on the platform, with each subscriber typically asking about 60 questions a month, during tutoring sessions that last between 15 to 20 minutes. The majority, or about two-thirds, of the questions are about math and science-related topics.One thing all of Snapask’s markets have in common are highly-competitive public exams to enter top universities, says Yu. The exams have both a positive and negative effect on education, he adds.;Students have a very clear objective about what topics they need to study, so that is driving a very lucrative market in the tutoring industry. But I think what Snapask focuses on is that exams are important, but you should do it the right way. We’re about self-directed learning. It’s not necessary to go to three-hour classes every day after school. If you need specific help on a question, you can ask for it immediately.;While at university, Yu worked as a math tutor, and sometimes spent a total of two hours commuting to sessions that lasted the same amount of time. In markets like Malaysia or Indonesia, many educators chose to work in major cities, leaving students in rural areas with less options. The goal of Snapask is to help solve those issues and connect tutors with more students.Yu says the average time for students to connect with a tutor after asking a question is about 15 to 20 minutes, which it is able to do because of machine learning-based technology that matches them based on educational styles, subject and availability. Snapask’s matching algorithms are also based on how students engage with tutors (for example, if they respond better to concise or longer, more elaborate answers). Students can also pick up to 15 to 20 tutors for their favorites list, who are prioritized when matching.Yu says Snapask screens tutors by looking at their university transcripts and public exam results. Then they go through a probation period on the platform to assess how they interact with students. The platform also tracks how many messages are sent during a tutoring session and response times to make sure that tutors are explaining students’ questions instead of just giving them the answers.Tutors can talk to up to 10 students at a time through Snapask’s platform. Yu says Snapask tutors in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and South Korea who spend about two hours per day answering questions usually make about $1,200 a month, while those who work about four to five hours a day can make about $4,000 to $5,000 a month. The company uses different pricing models in Southeast Asian markets, and Yu says tutors there can make about 50% to 60% more than they would at traditional tutoring jobs.Other study apps focused on students some of the same markets as Snapask include ManyTutors and Mathpresso, whose products combine tutoring services with tools that let students upload math questions, which are then scanned with optical character recognition to provide instant answers. Yu says Snapask is focusing on one-on-one tutoring because it wants to differentiate by creating a ;holistic experience.;;A lot of students come to Snapask after using OCR tools, which we know that user surveys, but they can’t get to certain steps. They still need someone to help them understand what is happening,; he says. ;So we try not to use technology for every component in teaching, but to make it more efficient and scalable, and we’re creating a holistic experience to differentiate us.;",https://tcrn.ch/37WikkJ
1949503,2020-02-25T21:30:55,Stonly grabs $3.5 million to make customer support more interactive,"Stonly is building a service for customer support teams so that they can share step-by-step guides to solve the most common issues users have. The startup just raised a $3.5 million funding round led by Accel with business angels also participating, such as Eventbrite CTO Renaud Visage and PeopleDoc founders Jonathan Benhamou and Clément Buyse.The startup isn’t building a chatbot for customer support — chatbots usually don’t understand what you mean and you end up contacting customer support anyway. Stonly  believes that scripted guides with multiple questions work much better than both chatbots and intimidating knowledge bases.But the company is well aware that it isn’t going to replace Zendesk or Intercom overnight. That’s why a Stonly guide is a module that you can embed in your existing tools. The startup currently supports Intercom, Zendesk, Freshdesk and Front.This way, if somebody contacts you on Front or Intercom, you can reply with a Stonly guide to help your users solve their own issues (at least if it’s a common issue). Stonly is also launching its own more traditional knowledge base powered by Stonly guides so that your client can access common questions through a chat widget.Putting together a Stonly guide doesn’t require any technical skills. After defining the steps, you can write text, add images, videos and buttons in a web interface. Stonly also supports translations.And it’s been working well for the startup’s first clients. For instance, Dashlane noticed a 25% decrease in opened tickets for their most frequent issues after using Stonly. Other clients include Devialet, Happn and Calendly.With today’s funding round, the startup is expanding to the U.S. with a new office in New York and David Rostan, VP of Sales and Marketing at Calendly, is joining as head of revenue.Stonly lets you create interactive step-by-step guides to improve support",https://tcrn.ch/2Vnavlb

Summarizing the executive;s comments: After seven years in business and quite a lot of work building out its product line and revenue base, BounceX wants to think of itself as something more than merely another SaaS company; the name Wunderkind, in his view, demands that what they create ;has to be extraordinary,; fitting into the idea.Normally we;d gently tease such plainly stated aspirations, but with $100 million in ARR and a history of efficient growth behind the goal, we won;t. Instead, let;s talk about what the company does, and how it has grown to the size that it has.What;s a BounceX?I;ll spare you the details and explain what the company does without buzzwords, as best I can.It starts with Web traffic. Everyone has it. But often you, an online retailer, don;t know who is coming to your website. BounceX (Wunderkind) can help you figure that out, matching anonymous web traffic to email addresses. Now you know some of the folks coming to your site, and how to reach them. Next, Wunderkind can help you send those identified folks targeted emails that match what is known about that person, or email address. The result of all this work is material revenue scale ; the company claims that its technology boosts ;behaviorally triggered emails to over 9%, on average, of a retailer’s digital revenue.;As 5 more startups join the $100M club, are we just making a pre-IPO list?For those doing the math at home, 9% is a lot.All this works out for Wunderkind as well, with its ability to help companies drive revenue assisting it in landing deals. The company closes new customers pretty efficiently, with Urban telling TechCrunch that his company;s CAC-to-LTV ratio is ;is probably the highest in [its] industry,; and has ;been going up over time.;How does it do that? By the company having what it called ;really high [deal] close rates.; Fine, but how does the tech drive the company;s close rate? By promising results and cutting itself off if it fails.Wunderkind runs short-term pilots with potential customers, say four months long. The company will only move to a more traditional SaaS contract if it sufficiently drives revenue for the potential customer. According to Urban, ;90 to 95% of the time; his company ;deliver[s] the guaranteed revenue.;And the customer converts, voila!This method of snagging customers led to Wunderkind having some pretty stellar SaaS metrics. Picking one from TechCrunch;s call with the CEO, ;a lot of [Wunderkind sales] reps have north of $3 million quotas a year and they hit,; he said, meaning that they meet that high expectation.So what?You can probably see where this is going: What happens when a company has a very strong customer value to customer acquisition cost structure, and a very efficient sales team? It doesn;t burn a lot of capital. Unsurprisingly, Wunderkind has been super efficient to date, with Urban telling TechCrunch that ;the amount of equity [his company has] actually put to work is probably sub-$35 million,; with less than $50 million in equity capital raised. The company also has debt lines that it can use, the CEO noted.Getting from $0 in ARR to $100 million while spending around $35 million in equity-sourced funds is pretty bonkers, but perhaps even more nuts is the fact that, per the CEO, Wunderkind got through its first four years on $1.5 million in external money. Urban chalked the low-burn results to the founding team and early employees having experience working with one another, and building features ;purely focused on improving experience [and] driving revenue.;That;s enough for now, we;ll write about the company more when it reaches its next ARR threshold, executes a secondary transaction to put off an IPO, or files. The lesson from today is that it;s possible to build a SaaS company to-scale with far less external capital than I thought possible. Anyhoo, Wunderkind joins the $100 million ARR cadre with what I think is the second-best result in terms of efficient growth. Only boostrapped Cloudinary has cleaner metrics, though with a smaller ARR total for now.For more on the $100 million ARR club, you can check out this and this to read about other companies that have been inducted this year.",https://tcrn.ch/32wFltd
1950778,2020-02-25T16:08:13,"VCs bet millions on Microverse, a Lambda School for the developing world","The student loan crisis in the U.S. has left venture capitalists searching for novel approaches to financing higher education, but can the same systems designed for helping coders in Silicon Valley get jobs at Google help underserved students in developing countries become part of a global work force?Similar to the buzzy San Francisco startup Lambda School,  Microverse is a coding school that utilizes ISAs, or Income Share Agreements, as a means of allowing students to learn now and pay later with a fixed percentage of their future salary. Microverse  isn;t aiming to compete heavily with Lambda School for U.S. students, however, they are looking more heavily at courting students in developing countries. The startup currently has students in 96 countries, with Mexico, Brazil, Kenya, Nigeria, Cameroon and India among their most represented, CEO Ariel Camus tells TechCrunch.The pitch of bringing the ISA model worldwide has attracted investor interest. The startup tells TechCrunch it has just closed $3.2 million in seed funding from venture capitalists including General Catalyst  and Y Combinator.WTF are ISAs and can they transform education and spark a startup wave?Lambda School and its ilk have excited plenty of investors. There has also been plenty of scrutiny and some questions on whether quickly scaling to venture-sized returns or building revenue by selling off securitized ISAs ends up pushing these startups toward cutting corners.Microverse, for its part, is already built quite lean. The program has no full-time instructors. The entire curriculum is a self-guided English-only lesson plan that relies on students that are just months ahead in the program serving as ;mentors.; Students are expected to spend eight hours per day pushing through the curriculum with assigned study partners and peer groups, graduating in about eight months on average, Camus says.;The average starting salary for us ; it;s of course lower and that;s expected,; said Camus. ;The only way we can offer as good or better learning experience as Lambda or any other campus-based education in the U.S. ; with salaries that will usually be lower ; is if our costs are lower, and that;s why we have designed the entire system to allow us to scale faster. We don;t have to hire teachers, we don;t have to create content and that allows us to adjust to changes in the market and new technologies much much faster.;While Lambda School;s ISA terms require students to pay 17% of their monthly salary for 24 months once they begin earning above $50,000 annually ; up to a maximum of $30,000, Microverse requires that graduates pay 15% of their salary once they begin making more than just $1,000 per month, though there is no cap on time, so students continue payments until they have repaid $15,000 in full. In both startups; cases, students only repay if they are employed in a field related to what they studied, but with Microverse, ISAs never expire, so if you ever enter a job adjacent to your area of study, you are on the hook for repayments. Lambda School;s ISA taps out after five years of deferred repayments.Without much of the nuance in how Lambda School or Holberton School have structured their ISA terms, Microverse;s structure seems less amenable, but Camus defends the terms as a necessary means to getting around under-reporting.;When you use a cap, you;re using a perverse incentive for under-reporting,; Camus says. ;In the U.S. where you can enforce tax reviews, there;s no need to worry about that and I think it;s better if you can cap it, but in most of the developing countries where there is not a strong tax system, it isn;t a possibility.;For students that qualify for terms for repaying this ISA, they are, again, on the hook for $15,000. Charging such a hefty fee for an online course without full-time instructors geared toward students in developing countries could be controversial for a venture-backed startup, but it will also put a heavy burden on the school to keep their students satisfied and help them find employment via its network of career counselors.The CEO acknowledges the high price of Microverse;s instruction. ;It is huge,; but he says that the premium is necessary to build a business around getting students in developing countries careers in the global workforce. Microverse is keeping its total number of admitted students small early on so that it can ensure it;s meeting their needs, Camus says, noting that Microverse accepts just 1% of applicants, adding 70-80 students to the program per month.;This conversation around the ISA in the U.S. is so hot that you have to frame it in such a different way when you;re talking about students in developing and emerging countries. Like, there are no alternatives,; Camus says. ;;if you can find a value proposition that aligns with their goals and gives them some international and professional exposure, that gives them a world-class education; that;s a very compelling proposition.;",https://tcrn.ch/2utLoCg
1951099,2020-02-25T16:06:44,"Salesforce grabs Vlocity for $1.33B, a startup with $1B valuation","It;s been a big news day for Salesforce . It announced that co-CEO Keith Block would be stepping down, and that it had acquired Vlocity for $1.33 billion in an all-cash deal.It;s no coincidence that Salesforce targeted this startup. It;s a firm that builds six industry-specific CRMs on top of Salesforce ; communications, media and entertainment, insurance and financial services, health, energy and utilities and government and nonprofits ; and Salesforce Ventures was also an investor. This would appear to have been a deal waiting to happen.Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials, says Salesforce saw this as an important target to keep building the business. ;Salesforce has been beefing up their abilities to provide industry-specific solutions by cultivating strategic ISV partnerships with companies like Vlocity  and Veeva (which is focused on life sciences). But this move signals the importance of making these industry capabilities even more a part of the platform offerings,; Leary told TechCrunch.Ray Wang, founder and principal analyst at Constellation Research, also liked the deal for Salesforce. ;It’s a great deal. Vlocity gives them the industries platform they need. More importantly, it keeps Google from buying them and [could generate] $10 billion in additional industries revenue growth over next four years,; he said.Salesforce co-CEO Keith Block steps downVlocity had raised about $163 million on a valuation of around $1 billion as of its most recent round, a $60 million Series C last March. If $1.33 billion seems a little light, given what Vlocity is providing the company, Wang says it;s because Vlocity needed Salesforce more than the other way around.;Vlocity on its own doesn’t have as big a future without Salesforce. They have to be together. So Salesforce doesn’t need to buy them. They could keep building out, but it’s better for them to buy them now,; Wang said.Still, the company was valued at $1 billion just under a year ago, and sold for $1.33 billion after raising $163 million. That means it received 8.2x total invested capital ($1.33 billion/ $163 million invested capital), which isn;t a bad return.In a blog post on the Vlocity website, founder and CEO David Schmaier put a positive spin on the deal. ;Upon the close of the transaction, Vlocity ; this wonderful company that we, as a team, have created, built, and grown into a transformational solution for six of the most important industries in the enterprise ; will become part of Salesforce,; he wrote.Per usual, the deal will be predicated on regulatory approval and close some time during Salesforce;s second quarter in fiscal 2021.Vlocity nabs $60M Series C investment on $1B valuation",https://tcrn.ch/2PsyE6m

Checkout.com surprised everyone last year when it announced a gigantic $230 million Series A round. It turns out the payment processing boom is not over yet.Checkout .com focuses on enterprise clients with customers all around the world. It provides a full-stack payment service, from accepting transactions, processing them and detecting fraud. It helps with reconciliation thanks to an API and a reporting hub.The startup is particularly efficient when it comes to supporting multiple currencies and payment methods. You can accept payments in more than 150 currencies. Checkout.com supports debit and credit cards, Apple Pay and Google Pay, as well as local payment methods such as Klarna, iDEAL and Giropay, and e-wallets such as PayPal and Alipay.A quiet London-based payments startup just raised among the biggest Series A rounds ever in EuropeProcessOut  is a French startup that realized e-commerce companies have been leaving money on the table by relying on a single payment provider. The company built a smart routing checkout module that works with dozens of payment providers.When you enter your card number, ProcessOut can select the best payment provider when it comes to fees and acceptance rate. For instance, a local payment provider can be a lot cheaper than Stripe, but transactions get declined a lot more often. The startup can figure out whether a transaction will go through before selecting an obscure payment provider.The company then shows you dashboards so you can visualize payment data in a single location. You can generate report and match transactions on your bank account with transactions on different payment providers.That combination of data visualization and smart routing helped them score some big clients, such as Glovo, Veepee, Rakuten.fr and Dashlane. In 2019, ProcessOut tracked 10% of online transactions in France. Transactions representing $20 billion have been analyzed by ProcessOut over the past 12 months.With today’s acquisition, ProcessOut’s team of 14 employees are joining Checkout.com’s team of 600 employees. Checkout.com isn’t disclosing the terms of the transaction. Checkout.com is getting a ton of insight on different payment providers. It can learn from ProcessOut’s technology to optimize its internal payment workflows, as well.",https://tcrn.ch/2SYW4lR
1950417,2020-02-25T10:04:52,Molekule hopes to clear the air with $58 million in Series C funding and Berkeley Lab;s testing,"Silicon Valley air purifier startup Molekule  was born out of an idea Dr. Yogi Goswami had back in the ;90s using photo-voltaic technology to kill air pollutants. His son, a young boy at the time, suffered from severe allergies and Dr. Goswami wanted to build something those like him could use in their home to clear the air. But the sleekly designed Molekule took a bit of a blow last fall when Wirecutter called it ;the worst air purifier we;ve ever tested.;Molekule has since told TechCrunch comparing its PECO technology to the more common HEPA air filter technology is like comparing apples to oranges. ;Up until now, everything has been air filtration, not real air purification,; co-founder and CEO of the company Jaya Rao told TechCrunch.To disprove the naysayers, Molekule sent off its tech for testing at the Berkeley Lab, which concluded no measurable amount of VOC;s or ozone were emitted; Molekule effectively removed harmful chemicals in the air, like toluene, limonene, formaldehyde, as well as ozone, and that ;no secondary byproducts were observed when the air cleaner was operated in the presence of a challenge VOC mixture.;Compare that to Wirecutter;s own assessment that, ;on its auto setting, which is its medium setting, the Molekule reduced 0.3-micron particulates by (in the best case) only 26.4 percent over the course of half an hour. Compare that with the 87.6 percent reduction the Coway Mighty achieved on its medium setting.; TechCrunch reached out to Wirecutter and was told it still stands by its findings and does not recommend consumers purchase a Molekule.It should be noted Consumer Reports also tested the Molekule device and it, too, did not recommend a purchase as the unit was not ;proficient at catching larger airborne particles.; However, Molekule demonstrated to other news outlets at its own facilities that the photochemical reaction in its units did break down contaminants and kill mold spores.Molekule pointed out to Techcrunch the Berkeley Lab did not test for particulate matter larger than .3 microns (which is what Wirecutter tested for) but Intertek Laboratories, which ran a separate test from Berkeley Lab on a Molekule unit, did.;To test PECO technology you actually need really sophisticated equipment,; Rao said. ;Boiling it down to really simple factors is not enough because air is made up of many tiny but toxic things. These are air-borne chemicals nanometers in size, which Wirecutter admittedly did not test at all for.;Wirecutter;s Tim Heffernan disputes Molekule;s claims of superiority in the category, however. ;Now they are comparing apples to oranges,; he told TechCrunch. ;The claims about destroying bacteria and viruses, for example, HEPA filters capture them and they capture them permanently.;So how;s a consumer to know what;s right? First, take into account Molekule commissioned the Berkeley Lab and Intertek for their independent testing and that Wirecutter and Consumer reports ran their own independent testing. However, it might boil down to understanding the premise of the technology. HEPA filters came out of the Manhattan Project in the 1940s, when scientists needed to develop a filter suitable for removing radioactive materials from the air. It works by capturing and filtering out harmful particles, viruses and mold. However, PECO, the technology in a Molekule unit, uses the science of light to kill mold and bacteria and break down harmful particulates in the air.Regardless of whether you want an air purifier that captures particulates or breaks them down, Molekule has continued to move forward. The company has since launched a mini unit meant for smaller rooms and started to grow business verticals outside of the direct-to-consumer model, forging partnerships with hotels and hospitals.It also just announced a raise of $58 million in Series C funding, bringing just over $91 million to its coffers. Rao tells TechCrunch the raise was unexpected, but came out of chats with Samantha Wang from RPS Ventures,  which led the round.;We feel confident in Molekule;s PECO technology, and have taken an extensive look at the science behind it. It is not only backed by decades of academic research, it has also gone through the peer-reviewed process numerous times, and has been tested and validated by third-party scientists and laboratories across the country,; Wang told TechCrunch.Other participation in the round included Founder’s Circle Capital and Inventec Appliances Corp (IAC). Existing investors Foundry Group,  Crosslink Capital,  Uncork Capital  and TransLink Capital also participated in the financing.Molekule also tells TechCrunch it has seen a healthy growth trajectory in the past year, despite the negative press. According to the company, Molekule has seen a 3x increase in year over year filter subscription revenue since launch, and its repeat customer growth sits at about 200%.It;s a well-designed, though pricier air purification machine with an interesting future in the commercial space, particularly in hospitals, schools, commercial manufacturing and hotels, as Wang points out.As long as the tech truly makes the air better.",https://tcrn.ch/38ZJHeP
1950787,2020-02-25T09:19:01,Cityscoot raises another $25.6 million for its electric moped service,"French startup Cityscoot is raising a $25.6 million (€23.6 million) funding round from Allianz France, Demeter as well as existing investors Groupe RATP and Banque des Territoires. The startup is also raising at least $6.5 million (€6 million) in debt in order to finance its service.Cityscoot  is a free-floating electric scooter service (moped scooters). Users can locate and unlock scooters using a mobile app. You can then park it and lock it again.The service is currently live in Paris, Nice, Milan and Rome. With today’s funding round, the startup plans to expand to two new European cities, starting with Barcelona in May 2020. Cityscoot will operate a fleet of 8,000 scooters.In Paris alone, Cityscoot handles 15,000 to 25,000 trips per day. Each trip lasts 15 minutes on average. Given that you pay €0.24 to €0.34 per minute, it means that Cityscoot is generating tens of thousands of euros of revenue per day in Paris.Over the past few months, Cityscoot has partnered with Uber so that you can locate and unlock scooters straight from the Uber app. It looks like the integration isn’t live yet.Cityscoot’s main competitor Coup shut down a couple of months ago. “Even though Coup is a well-known brand in this market with a loyal customer base that regularly uses our services, operating Coup in the long term has become economically unsustainable,” the company said at the time.Unit economics could be the reason why Cityscoot recently raised its prices. If you don’t top up your account, you now pay €0.34 per minute instead of €0.29 per minute. You pay less if you buy prepaid packages. This could be a great way to foster recurring use.",https://tcrn.ch/2PpLgLs
1950601,2020-02-25T08:44:51,"Startup malaise, startup ambition","Recapped. Layoffs. Slowdown. CEO transition. Budget cuts. Downsizing.In spite of a spate of massive startup exits the last few months, culminating in fintech’s shining moment yesterday with Intuit’s  $7.1 billion acquisition of Credit Karma, it’s been a tough period for the startup world. Layoffs abound, centered perhaps on SoftBank’s Vision Fund portfolio but hardly exclusive to it. Startups, both infamous and unheard of, are shutting their doors. And that doesn’t even begin to factor in the global macro concerns like coronavirus that will drive investor sentiment this year.There’s a bit of malaise underway in the startup world, a sense that possibilities are closing, that everything that will be built has been built, that tech itself is under an excruciating microscope by the public that makes innovation impossible.All of that may well be true. And yet, there remains so, so much more to get done.Whole sectors of the economy still need to be completely rebuilt from the ground up. Healthcare is barely digital, never personalized and based on almost no evidence or data whatsoever. Construction costs for housing and infrastructure have skyrocketed, with almost no real benefit to the end user whatsoever. Millions of people are facing student debt crises, and yet our school system doesn’t look all that much different from a century ago.Climate change itself is going to eat away at more and more of the planet, just as several billion more people come online, join the industrial and knowledge economies and demand the same amenities offered in the developed world. How do we offer air conditioning, housing, transportation, healthcare and more to every human on the planet? We need to 100x the global GDP while cutting carbon emissions, and billions of people are counting on us.Within organizations, we are still just beginning to figure out how design, data and decisions work together to drive product innovation and growth. I just wrote about a prototyping tool yesterday, following up on my colleague Jordan Crook’s look at what has been happening in the design world. Yes, the tools are getting better, but what would happen if a million more people could effortlessly design? Or what would happen if billions of people had access to no-code platforms more broadly? What could we empower them to create?Or just take our general experience with digital products. Our phones are faster, the photos they take are at exquisite resolutions and their svelte materiality remains superb. But do they really offer a seamless experience? I am still syncing files, tracking emails, attempting to connect a lunch meeting to my calendar and not dropping the details while flicking my fingers back and forth. The mundane nature of our daily software usage belies the reality that we use ridiculously elementary tools compared to what is possible even with today’s technology, no hand waving required.And then there is data. The data revolution in business, entertainment, government and more is barely in its infancy. Data may be slushing around large enterprises, but it hardly makes a dent on decision-making, even today. What would happen if we could use data more effectively? What if we could explore data even faster than today’s clunky BI tools? What if the best patterns for exploring data were readily available to every single person on Earth? What if we could instantly and easily build best-of-breed AI models to solve even our simplest decision-making problems?I could go on for pages and pages. From specific markets, to the dynamics within communities, and societies and companies, to the end users and the products they are offered, we are nowhere near the end of the innovation cycle. This isn’t Detroit circa a century ago, when hundreds of auto manufacturers and related companies eventually combined into a handful of today’s behemoths. There is still so much to do, and FAANG can’t do it all.What’s crazy is that within the right circles, there has never been a wider sense of awe at the gap between what we know to do and what we know we need to do. There are so many unsolved challenges today worth exploring that could not only help the lives of tens of millions of people, but that could also be multi-billion-dollar economies themselves.And so we need to bifurcate our sentiments. We do need to memorialize the failed startups, the ambitions that never quite made it. We need to recognize when mistakes are made, and have empathy for those affected by them. We shouldn’t ignore the negative news of our industry at all, lest we repeat the same blunders.Yet, a positive sentiment in the face of this avalanche of negative news and critical analysis is vital. You have to keep your eye on the future, on the change, on the power that still rests with all of us to make a difference right now. So much needs to be done, and the day is still young.",https://tcrn.ch/2SYXc9d

1937171,2020-02-25T08:35:13,Troubled Eaze finally closes $35M funding to sell its own cannabis,"Six weeks after we broke the news that cannabis startup Eaze was running out of money, laying off more employees and scrambling to pay its bills and stay afloat as it worked on a pivot to selling its own supply rather than just that of third-party providers, the company has finally closed some funding and appears to be moving forward with its plans.Today Eaze  ; which claims to have 600,000 registered customers and completed 5 million legal deliveries ; confirmed a bridge round of $15 million, plus a further $20 million as part of a Series D round of funding, totaling $35 million in funding. It will be using the money to help steer itself away from its original pure-marketplace model ; where it worked with third parties to source cannabis products, which it then sold on and delivered to users ; and into a strategy based around the idea of ;verticalization,; where Eaze itself will be running a retail and distributor operation of its own, alongside the resale of some 100 licensed brands via retail partners.;Verticalization is Eaze’s second act,; said CEO Ro Choy in a statement. “Until now, we’ve invested in proving our market fit, building an enormous and loyal customer base, and becoming California’s biggest marketplace for legal cannabis delivery. Now, we’re proving we can make this business work in a more sustainable and profitable way, while continuing to grow Eaze’s existing services.”We had reported that the fundraising was in the works in January. The Series D portion of the funding is coming from a group of investors led by a firm called FoundersJT LLC, and the bridge round is coming from Rose Capital and DCM, both previous investors. Eaze said that it has the facility to extend the Series D by another $20 million. It;s not disclosing its valuation.The news brings some resolution to a very troubled period at the startup, which has been through several executive changes, a couple of rounds of layoffs and general employee attrition ; losing key people like its chief strategy officer, its chief of staff and a number of engineering staff ; while struggling to build out a sustainable business working with cannabis retailers to use the Eaze platform to resell and deliver their products.(Along with the funding news it announced today, Eaze also said that Megan Miller, who had formerly been in finance, was appointed its new COO, while John Curtis became the new CFO.)Eaze;s big promise was to come out early and build a brand in the cannabis market, a very emerging area of consumer goods that had only relatively recently been decriminalised in California (and is still not completely legal everywhere).Tapping a new opportunity to sell cannabis products to a new class of consumers ; those who might not have been keen to purchase products when they were illegal, or already regular or semi-regular cannabis users who were happy to pay more for the convenience of using an app to shop and get delivery ; Eaze believed that California;s move was just the beginning of a bigger swing, and it projected growth across the U.S. accordingly. With one of its co-founders formerly an executive from Yammer, it became the first cannabis startup to raise money from Silicon Valley VCs, and positioned itself as the ;Uber of pot.;But as we;ve seen time and again, being an early mover is not always the best position in the tech world.The legalisation swing has not played out quite as Eaze predicted, and so the startup;s national expansion plans were curtailed. Meanwhile, in addition to dealing with the basic struggles that every e-commerce company faces ; customer acquisition, logistics and scaling a company;s business, talent and so on ; Eaze has had a number of challenges particular to its specific industry.They included issues around payment acceptance ; credit card companies didn;t want to allow the company to accept card payments, so for a while it operated on a cash-only model, prone to error, fraud and more ; through to poor (negative) margins reselling other retailers; products. And ultimately, legalisation meant a lot of price and product competition when it came to capturing customers.The funding Eaze announced today (which it has been trying to close for months) will be used in part to help specifically with a few of these challenges: margins and supply.We reported in January that Eaze was in the process of buying assets from a bankrupt former partner, DionyMed (which had, at one point, also been involved in a complicated lawsuit against Eaze), and that deal now has closed.Eaze will now resell product from DionyMed;s former subsidiary Hometown Heart (HTH), which has depots in Oakland and San Francisco, and Eaze said it will expand that with its own consumer brands ;in partnership with local licensees while continuing to support a broad array of independent, world-class California brands and independent licensed retailers across the state.;Despite all of the above problems, Eaze;s basic business appears to have been growing, which is likely the reason why the company and its investors believe there is something worth saving and restructuring.Eaze said that in 2019 it had a 97% annual increase in new sign-ups; 74% annual increase in first-time deliveries; a 71% annual increase in overall deliveries; and 104% annual increase in customers age 50+. Notably, it did not disclose today how many repeat, loyal customers it has amassed in that growth, so that is one to watch going forward.",https://tcrn.ch/2TfHaqf

1950577,2020-02-25T07:29:57,"For investors, late-stage fintech startups are a lucrative bet","Hello and welcome back to our regular morning look at private companies, public markets and the gray space in between.Over the past three months, a number of financial events have occurred in the fintech and finservices world that have caught our eye. Between two rounds at $500 million and two exits in the billions of dollars, financial technology and services startups have been on fire.Today I;d like to rewind and go over the four largest events from the past three months in fintech and finservices (total value: $13.4 billion) and pull in data on other rounds that have happened recently. This will help us get a handle on what;s going on in the two heated startup sectors.Recall that our last look into fintech;s venture activity wrapped up its Q4 2019 results. Today, thanks to the punishing news cycle that the sector has kept up over the last few weeks, we;re going a bit further. Into the breach!Four eventsWe have two rounds ($500 million rounds for Revolut  and Chime) and two sales (exits for Plaid  and Credit Karma) to wrap up today. Here;s what each of those deals might tell us about the current market for money-focused startups and investment, starting with our two rounds and followed by our two exits:Chime raises $500 million, boosting its valuation from $1.5 billion (March 2019) to $5.8 billion (December 2019). Chime;s round demonstrated that the neobanking boom, at least in terms venture interest, is far from over. The America-focused financial services company grew its accounts figure to 6.5 million, giving it a valuation of a little under $1,000 per account; how much revenue and margin it can extract from its existing accounts is almost a red herring given its current pace of growth. But even with the growth caveat, investors have bet big that its long-term revenues will help support a valuation of over $10 billion in time. (The company;s most recent investors expect material return on their funds.) This implies confidence in the long-term economics of neobanking and general bullishness on the company;s category ; so the existing 6.5 million accounts better churn out good chunks of top line.",https://tcrn.ch/38ZiPeX

1950529,2020-02-25T00:05:01,Grab raises up to $856M to boost payments business as rumors swirl of a merger with rival Gojek,"Southeast Asian on-demand transport startup Gojek denies that it is involved in talks to merge with Grab. But today Grab  announced a piece of news that ; at the very least ; will either divert attention away from a possible merger with Gojek or stoke the fires of speculation that it is indeed gearing up for a deal.Grab said that it has raised $856 million more in funding in two tranches from strategic Japanese investors. The funding will help grow the other arms of Grab;s business in payments and financial services. Grab did not disclose its valuation with the latest investments.The news comes directly on the heels of rumors that Grab is in talks to merge with its big regional rival, Gojek . Gojek has denied the reports directly to TechCrunch, while Grab declined to comment (but pointedly did not deny) although a source close to Grab confirms that they have been talking for 3.5 months ; starting just after Gojek;s founder and former CEO left the company in October to join Indonesian president Joko Widodo’s cabinet.The funding is coming in two tranches that were actually announced separately.The first, from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc, will see the firm invest ;up to $706 million into Grab to jointly develop next generation bespoke financial services in Southeast Asia to boost financial inclusion in the region,; the two said in a joint statement. MUFG and its regional affiliates will also become “First Choice Bank” to Grab, meaning that Grab will use MUFG first in countries where it operates when it requires a banking partnership for payments or other financial services.The second tranche is coming from TIS INTEC, an IT solutions business out of Japan, which is putting in $150 million along with a strategic deal to help Grab develop the infrastructure needed to run is growing financial services business, starting with digital payments by way of GrabPay.Both deals are important not just for Grab but its new investors, which are looking for more opportunities and customer channels into a wider region of Asia beyond their common home market of Japan.Grab;s growth of its ;super app; — in which it (like others pursuing a similar strategy) provides a one-stop shop for consumers to both see to their transportation needs, but also other aspects of their connected consumer life, such as eating, entertainment and managing their money — has involved the company partnering with a number of other financial giants, including Mastercard, Credit Saison, Chubb, and ZhongAn Online P&amp;C Insurance Co. Ltd.“MUFG’s investment into Grab is a vote of confidence in our super app strategy and our ability to build a long-term, sustainable business. Together with MUFG, we look forward to playing a key role in driving financial inclusion in Southeast Asia and offering greater and affordable access to financial products and services to millions of customers across the region,; said Ming Maa, President of Grab, in a statement.“MUFG has been developing business in Southeast Asia by building a platform centered on our partner banks. We are excited to be able to provide customers with next-generation financial services by combining Grab;s advanced technologies and data management expertise with our financial knowledge and know-how,; said Hironori Kamezawa, Deputy President, Group COO &amp; Group CDTO, MUFG, in a statement. ;We believe that this alliance will also generate additional momentum for our ongoing digital transformation of MUFG.”The financing development looks like it may have been precipitated by the report that surfaced on Monday from The Information, which reported that it is in merger discussions with Gojek, a ride-hailing business based out of Indonesia and also a big player in on-demand transportation and related services in the region.A Gojek spokesperson told TechCrunch that ;there are no plans for any sort of merger, and recent media reports regarding discussions of this nature are not accurate.; A Grab representative, meanwhile, said that the company declines to comment on market rumors and speculation.A merger is one possible solution to the costly rivalry being waged by the two companies in Southeast Asia and the statements may be an effort to ward off attention before a deal nears completion.With a $14 billion valuation and investors including SoftBank, Uber and Didi Chuxing, Grab is the larger company, but it competes head-to-head in Indonesia with Gojek, which has financial backing from Tencent, Google and Visa, among others. Both companies have expanded beyond ride-hailing into a wide range of services, including food deliveries and payments, through their apps.The logic here is that while ride-hailing has proven to be a very popular business (both in terms of attracting drivers and passengers in the two-sided marketplace), the unit economics of ride-hailing on their own have nevertheless proven time and again to be disastrous ; largely because the operational costs needed to build and run these kinds of businesses are just too high when you take into account the competitive landscape.The biggest companies in the space, such as Uber, have reported billions of dollars in operating losses, leading them to divest of some of the most unprofitable efforts to once-rivals — Grab for example has become involved in Uber;s business in Southeast Asia— and, parallel to that, invest big in expanding to other services to capitalise on their economies of scale.Thus, with Grab and Gojek, the pair have expanded into delivering other things besides passengers ; such as food ; and using the financial relationships they already have with users paying for transport in the app to provide other financial services.But even that may not be enough to tip into the black ; a need that investors would have eventually called in, after handing over billions in funding and waiting for many years to get a return. And that, most likely, is why we are now hearing about deals like this and will probably hear about more in other regions, too.According to the Information, executives from Gojek and Grab have met occasionally over the past several years and began to discuss a merger more seriously recently. But for now it;s the usual story: the two disagree over the businesses’ valuations and how control of the combined company would be split, with Grab telling its major investors that Gojek wants its shareholders to hold 50% of its combined Indonesian operations, and wish to avoid Gojek’s operations getting absorbed by Grab.If these talks don;t find their way to a signed contract, it;s not clear if either company will look for other strategic partners. For now, in addition to Grab;s funding, GoJek has been working on a round of its own, a monster $2.5 billion round that is likely to close in Q1 and could value the company at upwards of $10 billion.We;d heard from a single source that SoftBank was one of the investors that had been talking to GoJek, although another source close to GoJek disputes that claim. It appears that the company has been working on the round, a Series F, for more than a year at this point.One thing is certain: the bigger consolidation trend does mean the field of players is getting smaller.If they agree to merge, the two companies would potentially also deal with regulatory challenges similar to the ones Grab had to deal with when it bought Uber’s Southeast Asia operations in 2018.",https://tcrn.ch/3c8WKfV
1950188,2020-02-25T00:00:17,Speedinvest raises new €190M fund to continue backing early-stage European tech startups,"Speedinvest, the European seed-stage VC that was started from Vienna but has since added offices in London, Berlin, Munich and San Francisco, has raised a new €190 million fund. It brings the firm;s total assets under management to more than €400 million.Describing its third fund as ;oversubscribed; and ahead of schedule, SpeedInvest;s remit remains largely the same. The VC writes first cheques of between €50,000 and €1.5 million, but has also set aside €100 million of the fund for follow-on investments in its most promising portfolio companies.Sector-wise, Speedinvest  says it is targeting fintech, ;deep tech,; marketplaces, industrial tech, digital health and consumer tech startups ; so a pretty wide brief. To make this possible, the firm has what it describes as 40 investment professionals divided into teams working across these five sectors.In addition, the VC claims 20 ;operational experts; providing portfolio companies with ;full-service HR, growth marketing, business development, and U.S. expansion support.;Cue statement from Speedinvest CEO Oliver Holle: “Having been a founder myself, I have a clear view on value creation by investors. You need to deliver sector-specific, operationally relevant input that goes far beyond boardroom advice and cash. In our experience, the best way to do that is to be face-to-face with our founders;.Meanwhile, Speedinvest’s portfolio includes a number of Europe’s fast-growing tech companies, such as insurtech Wefox (€235 million Series B), e-scooter rentals company Tier Mobility (€55 million Series B), and fintech Curve (€50 million Series B). Other notable investments include Coachhub, TWAICE, Billie, Tourradar, Inkitt and Luko.In fact, Speedinvest says it has already invested in over ten startups from this new fund.Separately, it says it will be increasing its on the ground presence in France this Spring, where it has already invested in companies such as Luko, Lemon Way, Actiondesk and FairMoney.",https://tcrn.ch/37Q9Jjq
1950216,2020-02-24T16:00:07,Revolut raises $500 million at a $5.5 billion valuation,"Fintech startup Revolut is raising a large Series D round of funding. TCV is leading the $500 million round, valuing the company at $5.5 billion. Over the past few years, Revolut has raised $836 million in total.Some existing investors are also participating in today’s funding round, but Revolut  isn’t sharing names. Previous investors include DST Global, Index Ventures, Balderton Capital and many others.If you’re not familiar with Revolut, the company is building a financial service to replace traditional bank accounts. You can open an account from an app in just a few minutes. You can then receive, send and spend money from the app or use a debit card.On top of that, Revolut has added a ton of features that it has built in-house or through partnerships. You can insure your phone, get a travel medical insurance package, buy cryptocurrencies, buy shares, donate to charities, save money and more.Revolut currently has more than 10 million customers, mostly in Europe and the U.K. The company doesn’t share specific numbers when it comes to transaction volume and monthly active customers, but here are some percentage-based metrics:The total number of users has grown by 169% in 2019.Daily active customers grew by 380% in 2019.Revenue grew by 354% in 2018 (yes, 2018).Revenue from premium subscription plans (Revolut Premium and Revolut Metal) have grown by 154% in 2019.With the new influx of cash, the company says that it’ll focus on improving its product for existing users as well as revenue. It’s all about making Revolut more useful and stickier going forward.In particular, you can expect new lending services for both retail customers as well as companies using Revolut for Business. While Revolut provides a ton of services in the U.K., customers in other markets don’t have the same feature set. For instance, Revolut recently launched savings vaults in the U.K. — customers in other markets will be able to open savings sub-accounts in the future, as well.Other than that, Revolut wants to double down on the core features. The company will improve its two subscription tiers (Premium and Metal) and improve banking operations across Europe — you can expect full bank accounts in Europe in the future.There are currently 2,000 people working for Revolut. “We’re on a mission to build a global financial platform ; a single app where our customers can manage all of their daily finances, and this investment demonstrates investor confidence in our business model. Going forward, our focus is on rolling-out banking operations in Europe, increasing the number of people who use Revolut as their daily account, and striving towards profitability,” Revolut co-founder and CEO Nik Storonsky said in the release.Revolut is currently live in the U.K., Europe, Singapore and Australia (in beta). While the company has announced plans to expand to a handful of countries, the main focus is on launching in the U.S. and Japan in the coming months.",https://tcrn.ch/37SnTAt

Can you be more specific regarding the size of check you write and the types of companies, geographies, technologies and business models you are focusing on?Richard Anton: We will lead funding rounds anywhere in the range $5-20 million in SaaS companies. Some themes we’re especially excited about include data convergence and the refining and usage of data (think applications of machine learning, for example), the future of work, financial services infrastructure, end-user empowerment and sustainable business.",https://tcrn.ch/37RpxCl
1950437,2020-02-24T15:22:56,Mirantis co-founder launches FreedomFi to bring private LTE networks to enterprises,"Boris Renski, the co-founder of Mirantis,  one of the earliest and best-funded players in the OpenStack  space a few years ago (which then mostly pivoted to Kubernetes and DevOps), has left his role as CMO to focus his efforts on a new startup: FreedomFi. The new company brings together open-source hardware and software to give enterprises a new way to leverage the newly opened 3.5 GHz band for private LTE and ; later ; 5G IoT deployments.;There is a very broad opportunity for any enterprise building IoT solutions, which completely changes the dynamic of the whole market,; Renski told me when I asked him why he was leaving Mirantis. ;This makes the whole space very interesting and fast-evolving. I felt that my background in open source and my existing understanding of the open-source landscape and the LTE space [;] is an extremely compelling opportunity to dive into headfirst.;Renski told me that a lot of the work the company is doing is still in its early stages, but the company recently hit a milestone when it used its prototype stack to send messages across its private network over a distance of around 2.7 miles.Mirantis itself worked on bringing Magma, a Facebook-developed open-source tool for powering some of the features needed for building access networks, into production. FreedomFi is also working with the OpenAirInterface consortium, which aims to create an ecosystem for open-source software and hardware development around wireless innovation. Most, if not all, of the technology the company will develop over time will also be open source, as well.Renski, of course, gets to leverage his existing connections in the enterprise and telco industry with this new venture, but he also told me that he plans to leverage the Mirantis playbook as he builds out the company.;At Mirantis, our journey was that we started with basically offering end-to-end open-source cloud buildouts to a variety of enterprises back when OpenStack was essentially the only open-source cloud project out there,; he explained. ;And we spent a whole bunch of time doing that, engaging with customers, getting customer revenue, learning where the bottlenecks are ; and then kind of gradually evolving into more of a leveraged business model with a subscription offering around OpenStack and then MCP and now Kubernetes, Docker, etc. But the key was to be very kind of customer-centric, go get some customer wins first, give customers a services-centric offering that gets them to the result, and then figure out where the leveraged business model opportunities are.;Currently, enterprises that want to attempt to build their own private LTE networks ; and are willing to spend millions on it ; have to go to the large telecom providers. Those companies, though, aren;t necessarily interested in working on these relatively small deployments (or at least ;small; by the standards of a telco).Renski and his team started the project about two months ago and for now, it remains self-funded. But the company already has five pilots lined up, including one with a company that produces large-scale events and another with a large real estate owner, and with some of the tech falling in place, Renski seems optimistic that this is a project worth focusing on. There are still some hurdles to overcome and Renski tells me the team is learning new things every day. The hardware, for example, remains hard to source and the software stack remains in flux. ;We;re probably at least six months away from having solved all of the technology and business-related problems pertaining to delivering this kind of end-to-end private LTE network,; he said.",https://tcrn.ch/2Tdkk2p

Instead, there are testimonials from older, ex-smokers hawking the Lucy gum.;I don’t want anyone underage using any nicotine product or any drug in general… [and] the flavors have been around for a long time.;Joining Renteln in the quest to create a better nicotine gum is Samy Hamdouche, a former business development executive at several Southern California biotech startups and the previous vice president of research at Soylent. For both men, the idea is to get a new product to market that can help people quit smoking ; without a social stigma ; Renteln said.“Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States claiming over 480,000 lives every year and costing the U.S. an estimated $300 billion in direct health costs and lost productivity.

1950155,2020-02-24T10:37:59,Deviceplane wants to bring over-the-air updates to Linux edge devices,"Deviceplane, a member of the Y Combinator Winter 2020 class, is developing an open-source toolset to manage, monitor and update Linux devices running at the edge.;We solve the hard infrastructure problems that all these companies face, including network conductivity, SSH access, orchestrating and deployment of remote updates, hosting, application monitoring and access and security controls. It;s 100% open source, available under an Apache License. You can either host it yourself or you can run on the hosted version,; company founder and CEO Josh Curl told TechCrunch.He could see this working with a variety of hardware, including robotics, consumer appliances, drones, autonomous vehicles and medical devices.Curl, who has a background in software engineering, was drawn to this problem and found that most companies were going with home-grown solutions. He said once he studied the issue, he found that the set of infrastructure resources required to manage, monitor and update these devices didn;t change that much across industries.The over-the-air updates are a big part of keeping these devices secure, a major concern with edge devices. ;Security is challenging, and one of the core tenets of security is just the ability to update things. So if you as a company are hesitant to update because you;re afraid that things are going to break, or you don;t have a proper infrastructure to do those upgrades, that makes you more hesitant to do upgrades, and it slows down development velocity,; Curl said.Customers can connect to the Deviceplane  API via Wi-Fi, cellular or ethernet. If you;re worried about someone tapping into that, Curl says the software assigns the device a unique identity that is difficult to spoof.;Devices are assigned an identity in Deviceplane and this identity is what authorizes it to make API calls to Deviceplane. The access key for this identity is stored only on the device, which makes it impossible for someone else to spoof this device without physical access to it.;Even if someone were able to spoof this identity, they would not be able to deploy malicious code to the spoofed device. Devices never have access to control what software they;re running ; this is something that can be done only by the developer pushing out updates to devices,; Curl explained.The company intends to offer both the hosted version and installed versions of the software as open source, something that he considers key. He hopes to make money supporting companies with more complex installations, but he believes that by offering the software as open source, it will drive developer interest and help build a community around the project.As for joining YC, Curl said he has friends that had been through the program in the past, and had recommended he join as well. Curl sees being part of the cohort as a way to build his business. ;We were excited to be tapping into the YC network ; and then being able to tap into that network in the future. I think that YC has funded many companies in the past that can be Deviceplane customers, and that can accelerate going forward.;Curl wasn;t ready to share download numbers just yet, but it;s still an early-stage startup looking to build the company. It;s using an open-source model to drive interest, while helping solve a sticky problem.",https://tcrn.ch/2SYdOhr
1950191,2020-02-24T10:21:20,Boom says its supersonic XB-1 aircraft test program will be ;fully carbon neutral;,"Commercial aviation isn;t typically the place to look if you;re after carbon-light initiatives. Jet fuel isn;t generally very green, and airplanes burn a lot of it when traversing the skies. But supersonic flight startup Boom wants to change the perception of commercial aviation as an emissions-costly prospect, starting with their testing development program for the XB-1 supersonic demonstration aircraft that will eventually lead to the development of its Overture passenger aircraft.Boom claims this will make it the first commercial flight OEM to achieve this level of sustainability, especially from the very beginning of its aircraft flight testing and certification process. And while XB-1 and eventually Overture aren;t electric or hybrid aircraft, the way the company hopes to achieve this milestone is through a combination of using sustainable jet fuel and carbon offsets (effectively the process of buying carbon ;credits; by funding projects that net reduce greenhouse gases) to reduce its overall carbon footprints to zero.The fuel that Boom is using comes from partner Prometheus Fuel, which is a company that uses electricity from renewable power sources, like solar and wind, to turn CO2 scrubbed from the air into jet fuel. Already, Boom has tested this fuel in use during some of its initial ground tests, and its findings indicate that it should be able to use it effectively through both the remainder of ground testing, as well as into its flight program.While there is some debate about the overall validity and efficacy of carbon offsets, provided that money from these programs is funneled into the proper initiatives, they do seem to result in more ecological good than not. And any attempt to offset the economic impact of a flight program like Boom;s, especially if it;s carried through to flying production aircraft, should be better for the environment than had no attempt been made whatsoever. Which, by the way, is the case for most new aircraft development programs.Already, Boom is in the process of building the XB-1, which it will then flight test in partnership with Flight Research during a program in the Mojave Desert at the Mojave Air and Space Port. The goal is to begin testing this summer, and eventually use the information gathered from the XB-1 program (which will be able to hold a pilot but no passengers) to build out the final Overture aircraft that will offer commercial passenger supersonic flight services. Boom has secured agreements with a number of airlines for pre-orders for Overture, including JAL and Virgin.",https://tcrn.ch/2TfKwtg
1949690,2020-02-24T09:00:54,ProtoPie helps designers translate their work to engineering without the hassles,"It’s the golden age of design for software companies. Designers are becoming more visible and popular on engineering teams, figuring out everything from the visuals of color palette and fonts to the deeper interaction flows and user experience journeys that underlie products. As my colleague Jordan Crook recently described, that popularity has translated into one of the big venture gold rushes to serve this newly empowered enterprise customer.Design may be the next entrepreneurial gold rushYet, between the Figmas and the InVisions and the Adobes lies a very specific challenge for designers: finding a way to translate prototypes from their heads into usable products for engineers to build on. Most of the design tools on the market help designers build their own prototypes independently, or collaborate with other designers. Worse, they often are unable to handle the complexity of modern digital products, which can end up on a range of end devices.That’s where ProtoPie comes in. The service empowers designers to create high-fidelity prototypes of products, including products that might end up in such places as digital display kiosks, automobile dashboard screens, mobile phones and others. The tool can also adapt prototypes based on readings from sensors like motion detection. Those prototypes, once accepted, can then be easily handed off to engineering teams for implementation.In short, it’s “prototyping as easy as pie.”The Seoul, South Korea-based company was founded by Tony Kim, a former designer at Google, along with two lead engineers at Samsung and Line. Kim left in December 2014 after getting fed up with existing design tools on the market and the lack of a clear winner in the interaction prototyping space.ProtoPie founder Tony Kim (Photo via ProtoPie) Over the past few years, he and his team have been building out the full feature set and growing the company within the design community following the product’s first launch in January 2017. Now, the company is charting a vastly growing curve following a switch to enterprise licensing last year, announcing today a $6.3 million expansion of its Series A round led by Vela Partners. The company has collected a total of $9.9 million in venture capital since its founding.Jenna Yim, who is chief strategy officer, offered an example of a car manufacturer prototyping a product. Most existing software tools focus on validating user flow, so you “click, click, click, and see how the screens transition,” she explained. But what happens if those screens should change depending on whether the user is in the driver’s seat or passenger seat, or whether the car is traveling at high-speed and safety is a concern? ProtoPie is “a lot more expressive than other tools you might see,” she said. “Because of our concept model, we can also create the interaction between multiple device interactions without any code.”The company says that it has 100,000 global paid users, with major deals with Microsoft, Google and other prominent tech companies. CEO Kim says that “even though we are based in Seoul, South Korea, most of our revenues come from outside of Korea … the U.S. market is one of the big parts, followed by Japan, Germany, and China.”With the new funding, the company intends to expand its sales team in North America, potentially launching a more expansive headquarters there as well. Kim says he also wants to expand the product’s collaboration features like its content library, so that users can pull pre-made components from other designers online.The startup currently has 33 people, mostly based out of its office in Gangnam, Seoul, and has an “everyone can work from everywhere” culture.",https://tcrn.ch/37O0u3e
1950017,2020-02-24T06:50:39,"Equity Monday: Stocks fall, Square earnings, and Capiche raises $1.1M","Good morning friends, and welcome back to TechCrunch’s Equity Monday, a short-form audio hit to kickstart your week. Regular Equity episodes still drop Friday morning, so if you’ve listened to the show over the years don’t worry — we’re not changing the main show. (Here’s last week’s episode with Danny Crichton if you want to listen; I also just got the pun in the headline.)Starting off this week the news is not very good.I start to prep for Equity Monday on Fridays, keeping tabs of themes and news cycles. By the time it;s Sunday night I have a good idea of what the show is going to focus on. And I;m a little tired it being bad news about the coronavirus. Here;s to hoping that we, as a species, make material progress to stopping the damn thing.In more mundane terms, the disease continued to shutter cities and countries, slowing the global economy. I;d rather focus on the human side of the story, but I;m a financial and technology journalist, so here we are.Markets around the world are down sharply. Stocks in the United States are set to fall. Tech companies are pipped by pre-market trading to fall even further. Growth and SaaS public shops look set to take the sharpest hit.Turning to funding rounds this week, just one. Instead of covering a number of funding events in the early-stage market, we;re discussing a single round raised by Capiche ; a $1.1 million investment sourced from a number of small angel groups and venture firms. The company ; here, on the Internet ; is working to connect SaaS customers and power users so that they can share tips, pricing information, and negotiation tactics. As literally everyone knows, the SaaS market is too opaque. Also major tracking entities are thought by some to be too favored towards vendors. Capiche wants to tilt the balance of power towards users, instead.If that will prove a lucrative model isn;t yet clear, but Capiche is a young company with its first real check. It has time to prove itself. According to CEO Austin Smith, his company has nearly two years (seven quarters) of runway in the bank without generating revenue. The startup intends to turn on income far before its money runs out, of course.I think we;ll cover more individual rounds on Equity Monday over time as it;s more fun than running through a short, partially-themed list.Finally, I riffed for you on the Credit Karma-Intuit deal that is supposed to be coming very, very soon, in a formal sense. $7 billion is a lot of money to start the week.Happy Monday!Equity drops every Friday at 6:00 am PT, so subscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts.",https://tcrn.ch/3c1UTJS
1949661,2020-02-24T06:00:11,The Plaid ;mafia; begins with John Whitfield joining student loan fintech startup Summer,"So far this year, one of the most eye-popping startup exits has been Visa’s $5.3 billion acquisition of  fintech data services platform Plaid. It’s a major exit in the white-hot fintech space, and while that transaction is still going through regulatory reviews, already some current Plaid employees are becoming alumni and fanning out into the broader startup ecosystem. Could this be the start of a brand new mafia born out of fintech, à la PayPal?Visa;s Plaid acquisition shows a shifting financial services landscapeJohn Whitfield announced this morning that he will be joining Summer as its head of engineering. As I described the company a few months ago following its Series A fundraise:The public benefit corporation is on a mission to act as a “trusted advisor” to student loan borrowers. Through its platform, borrowers can get a full 360-degree view of their current student loan situation, and begin exploring options for how to repay it in the most financially efficient way possible.Summer wants to vanquish student loans for borrowers, and now has $10M to do it“At my heart I am a builder,” Whitfield explained to me. He joined Plaid through the startup’s acquisition of financial analytics service Quovo in early 2019, and built out the company’s New York engineering team as an engineering manager this past year. Prior to joining Quovo, Whitfield was CTO of popular New York City-based pizza slice delivery app Slice.Plaid snags Quovo to build full-service financial API offeringFor Whitfield, Summer is an opportunity to take advantage of a combination of his skills coming from a consumer-facing app and B2B2C model like Slice and the fintech integration architecture of Plaid. It’s also a mission-oriented company. “I am a parent of a child in college, and I am familiar within my community how [student loans] affects students and parents,” he said. Whitfield says he has been interested in joining companies once they have proven traction and need to scale from thousands to millions of users.John Whitfield of Summer (Photo via Summer)Prior to beginning his tech career, Whitfield was a classical cellist and holds a Doctor of Music Arts.Will Sealy,  CEO and founder of Summer, said that expanding the engineering and data teams will be a huge priority this year. “We are at 25 full-time employees right now, and scaling to 40 by the end of the year,” he said. “And a lot of them will be in engineering and data science.”Sealy noted that the student loan space is deeply complex, with 16 types of student loans, all kinds of private options and more than 100 loan assistance programs available to borrowers, the rules of which change every year. The hope is that Whitfield will be able to bring his lessons learned from Plaid to think how best to integrate all the streams of data in this complicated space.As for Summer’s product itself, Sealy and Whitfield said that the big priority this year is to go beyond its “optimization algorithm,” which recommends to its users how to pay their student loans in the best possible way, to actually executing the payments themselves, turning Summer into a “one-stop shop” for all student loans. Expect to hear more from this company soon.",https://tcrn.ch/32nGqnl
1949927,2020-02-24T05:05:02,Karius raises $165 million for its liquid biopsy technology identifying diseases with a blood draw,";What Karius is good at is identifying those novel microbes before they become an outbreak like coronavirus,; says Mickey Kertesz, a chief executive whose life sciences startup just hauled in $165 million in new funding.While the new money may have been raised under the looming threat of Covid 19, the company;s technology is already being used to test for infection-causing pathogens in immunocompromised pediatric patients, and for potential causes of complex pneumonia, fungal infections and endocarditis, according to a statement from the company. Liquid biopsy technology has been widely embraced in cancer treatments as a way to identify which therapies may work best for patients based on the presence of trace amounts of genetic material in a patient;s bloodstream that are shed by cancer cells.Karius applies the same principles to the detection of pathogens in the blood ; developing hardware and software that applies DNA sequencing and machine learning techniques to identify the genetic material that;s present in a blood sample.As the company explains, microbes infecting the human body leave traces of their DNA in blood, which are called microbial cell-free DNA (mcfDNA). The company;s test can measure the cell-free DNA of more than 1,000 clinically relevant samples from things like bacteria, DNA viruses, fungi and parasites. These tests indicate the types of quantities of those pathogens that are likely affecting a patient. ;We;re through the early stages of adoption and clinical studies show that the technology literally saves lives,; says Kertesz.Its early successes were enough to attract the attention of SoftBank, which is backing the company through capital raised for its second Vision Fund.While SoftBank has been roundly criticized for investing too much too soon (or too late) into consumer startups which have not lived up to their promise (notably with implosions at Brandless, Zume and the potential catastrophe known as WeWork), its life sciences investing team has an impressive track record. ;They have the experience and the expertise and the network that’s very relevant to us,; Kertesz said of the decision to take SoftBank;s money. ;That’s the team that was on the board of Guardant Health [and] 10X Genomics.;Both of those companies have proven to be successful in public markets and with validated technology. That;s a feature Karius shares. The company;s published an analytical and clinical validation of its test in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Microbiology showing that its test identified more quickly and more accurately the likely pathogens causing an infection when compared to standard methods. With initial validation behind it, the company raised its new cash to pursue rapid commercial adoption for its tests and to continue validating applications of its technology while exploring new ones.Among the primary areas of exploration is the identification of new biomarkers, which could serve as indicators for new diseases (like Covid 19).;As humanity we haven;t figured out infectious diseases yet,; said the company chief technology officer, Sivan Bercovici.  “For the microbial signatures that our technology can’t identify, we continuously bring in additional high-quality genomic blueprints from public databases, and we separately aggregate that data in a pool we call  ;dark matter; for further investigation. One of the biggest challenges is how to know that you simply don’t know,”Karius  works by digitizing the microbial information in a blood sample and uses machine learning and DNA  sequencing to recognize the microbial signatures. The company uses public databases that have records of over 300,000 pathogens. For the ones that the company can;t identify, it creates a identifier for those as well.At $2,000 per test, Karius; biopsies aren;t cheap, but they;re safer and more cost-effective than surgeries, according to Kertesz. It;s obviating the need to dig into a patient for a piece of tissue and the technology is already being used in more than 100 hospitals and health systems, the company said.With that kind of reach, new investors, including General Catalyst  and HBM Healthcare Investments, were willing to sign on with SoftBank;s Vision Fund and previous investors like Khosla Ventures and LightSpeed Venture Partners to participate in the latest round.“Infectious diseases are the second leading cause of deaths worldwide. Karius; innovative mcfDNA technology accurately diagnoses infections that cannot be determined by other existing technologies,” said Deep Nishar, senior managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. &nbsp;",https://tcrn.ch/3a0vKxi
1949516,2020-02-24T01:00:32,Chattermill raises $8M Series A to enable companies to gain customer feedback insights ;at scale;,"Chattermill, the London startup that offers what it calls a ;customer understanding; platform that uses machine learning to gain scalable insights into customer feedback, has raised $8 million in Series A funding.Leading the round is DN Capital, alongside Ventech and btov Partners. Silicon Valley Bank also participated, in addition to a number of angel investors including Matt Price (Senior Vice President at Zendesk), and Nilan Peiris (VP Growth at Transferwise). Existing investors Entrepreneur First, Avonmore Developments and 2be.lu also followed on.I;m also told that Price, who previously led Zendesk’s growth in EMEA, will join the Chattermill board as Non-Executive Director.Co-founded by Mikhail Dubov and Dmitry Isupov in 2015 while going through the company builder program run by Entrepreneur First, Chattermill was born out of a frustration that it can take weeks or months for customer research to yield any quality insights, which would then be out of date by the time it reached decision makers and action could be taken. Like many problems of scale, the pair believed machine learning could be an important part of the solution, coupled with an accessible user interface that surfaces customer feedback across multiple channels in an actionable way.Since then, Chattermill’s platform has been used by a number of high-growth companies, such as HelloFresh, Uber, Deliveroo and Zappos. London fintech darling Transferwise was also an earlier customer ; so perhaps its unsurprising that its VP of Growth is now an investor.“Chattermill enables our team to take customer insights deeper than ever before and focus on the key factors that make a difference to our users and drive our growth,; said Transferwise;s Peiris. ;I’ve seen first-hand the value a product like Chattermill’s can add to a company, and that’s why I decided to invest in this round.;Agonistic to where the customer feedback is generated, Chattermill integrates with lots of third-party software, aggregating various feedback such as surveys, reviews, support tickets and social media.;We have built a large library of pre-built connections to the most popular customer feedback systems such as SurveyMonkey, Trustpilot, Zendesk and Salesforce,; explains Chattermill co-founder Mikhail Dubov.;A new customer would usually connect a few of these data sources to start with. We then build a model to understand their customer experience from both the data we see and knowledge already embedded in our system. Once this is done, we can start delivering analytics and insights directly to their users in real time and with high accuracy, enabling businesses to make better-informed decisions at a faster speed and scale.;Asked what assumptions Chattermill got right after raising its seed round in December 2017, Dubov says two key strategies have panned out well. One was to go after ;customer-focused; businesses at the start, and the other was to double down on the depth of insights and the product;s ease of use versus ;over-investing; in specific machine learning technologies.;This meant our offering became even more powerful as NLP made a huge step forward in the last two years with models such as GPT and BERT,; Dubov explains. ;We were able to swap out parts of our model to improve quickly rather than being attached to a specific architecture;.However, not everything was foreseen, and Dubov says he didn;t anticipate how much the tech landscape around customer experience would change. ;With the acquisitions of Qualtrics and IPOs from Medallia and SurveyMonkey, we now see a lot more attention to the sector from both customers and investors,; he says. ;We also see a lot more interest in extracting insight from customer conversations via chat and voice than we did two years ago;.",https://tcrn.ch/37ZuRE4
1949413,2020-02-24T00:30:54,Spain;s Cobee raises €2.1M for its employee benefits app and payment card,"Cobee, a Spanish fintech startup that has developed an employee benefit management app and accompanying card, has closed €2.1 million in ;pre-Series A; funding.The round was co-led by Speedinvest and Target Global. Other backers include Chris Bouwer (an early employee of Adyen) and existing investors Encomenda Smart Capital, BStartup (Banco Sabadell), Lanai Partners and Abac Nest.Founded in 2018 by Borja Aranguren and Daniel Olea, Cobee aims to help employees ;leverage better economic performance; from their salary via a range of employee benefits and discounts offered through the platform. These are managed within the Cobee app and redeemed through use of the Cobee payment card.The draw for companies signing up is that Cobee already claims its platform has higher engagement than many existing employee benefit programmes. And by being a fully digital and automated solution, there is considerably less administration needed to manage the programme.;We realized that there is an increasing number of solutions that are being sold as benefits or products to the end employees through their HR department (gyms, insurance products, perks, vouchers, salary sacrifice formulas, etc.),; Cobee co-founder and CEO Borja Aranguren tells TechCrunch. ;This, on the one hand, means administrative hassle for the HR departments to manage all the different providers and processes and, most importantly, on the other hand, brings a totally fragmented and unclear value proposition for the employee;.With this problem in mind, Aranguren and Olea set out to build Cobee, which the pair describe as a fintech HR solution that empowers employees to consume their compensation and benefits on-demand.;All our efforts are focused on making employees feel happy about their benefits, trying to unify the value proposition in an understandable and easy to use formula,; Aranguren explains. ;For the companies, we offer an easy-to-use SaaS platform to configure their benefit offering and upload their employees. For the employees, it is an app and a payment card to consumer those benefits as they like, with funds coming from a company subsidy or from their own salary;.The current Cobee offering includes benefits like meals, transportation, childcare, health insurance and training courses. Additional options, such as gym membership, are said to be coming in the next few months.;Our product can cater for companies of all sizes, from SMEs or startups to large corporations of any sector,; adds Aranguren. ;However, our main target segment are those companies ranging between 50 to 5,000 employees. We have customers and users like Petronas, Avis Budget Group, Opinno, Glovo, and Willis Towers Watson;.Meanwhile, Cobee says it will use the new funding to ;scale up its business model; in Spain and expand into international markets. To support its mission to become a European category leader, the company plans to strengthen its team and enhance its platform by integrating new products and benefits.The business model is straightforward, too: Cobee charges companies a SaaS fee per active employee. ;We follow a pure success-based approach and we only win if the employees win, which, after all, makes the companies win,; says the Cobee CEO. ;Besides that, we leverage purchasing volumes to build a marketplace that we can monetize and that also allows us to create savings that can be transferred to our end customers/employees.;",https://tcrn.ch/2TaNbV9

He;ll be leading the firm’s early-stage investments in its London office. Described as a serial angel investor and an early backer of Revolut, Schäfer was most recently part of Seedcamp’s investment team, as well as a Venture Partner with Cherry Ventures.“We are happy to strengthen our London team with such an experienced and successful early-stage investor,; says Alex Frolov, General Partner and CEO at Target Global, in a statement. ;With his focus on fintech and proptech, and a hands-on, entrepreneurial approach, we feel that it’s an excellent match both for our Target Global investment strategy and our culture.;",https://tcrn.ch/3a0zpeI
1949955,2020-02-23T22:59:50,"Created to help employees figure out health benefits, HealthJoy raises $30 million","HealthJoy, a platform designed to make it easier for employees to use their healthcare benefits, has raised $30 million in Series C funding led by Health Velocity Capital. Returning investors also participated, including U.S. Venture Partners, Chicago Ventures, Epic Ventures, Brandon Cruz and Clint Jones. This brings HealthJoy’s  total funding so far to $53 million.By integrating with healthcare service providers and partnering with benefit consultant agencies, HealthJoy simplifies the process of finding and using benefits. Its features include an AI-based virtual assistant and healthcare concierges. The startup says it has a monthly login rate of 33% and that its clients, which now includes 500 employers, see a tenfold increase in the employee use of benefits, including telemedicine.Since TechCrunch covered HealthJoy’s Series B round last year, the company has launched two new services. One is a price transparency tool called HealthJoy Rewards that allows companies to provide incentives for employees to use more cost-efficient services.;For example, an MRI in Chicago can vary in price from around $500 for an independent clinic to around $3,500 in a hospital system,; HealthJoy founder and CEO Justin Holland told TechCrunch. ;Our rewards platform allows companies to customize the incentive, but we provide nearly 100 recommendations. We’re showing an amazing ROI for companies that have adopted the program since we’re targeting high-cost procedures.;The second new service is called HealthJoy EAP, an employee assistance program that Holland says is a priority for further development. It gives 24/7 access to short-term counseling, with several sessions available for free.;Addressing mental heath is of extreme importance for companies in today’s world. Access to traditional counseling is on decline in many rural areas due to lack of access. In cities, costs have risen so many users are priced out of the market,; he says.The funding will also be used to improve HealthJoy;s virtual assistant, develop new services, integrate with more partners and aggregate data. HealthJoy plans to add 200 employees in its Chicago office during 2021, with the goal of doubling its engineering team. Future plans include working with more small- to medium-sized businesses and a potential partnership to serve Medicare recipients.Other startups focused on employee benefits include League, Catch and Collective Health. Holland says HealthJoy integrates with, instead of competing with, benefits administration platforms and differentiates by being able to work with any benefits package.Health Velocity Capital partner Saurabh Bhansali will join HealthJoy’s board of directors. In a press statement, Bhansali said: ;HealthJoy offers proven technology solutions to help navigate employees through our nation’s complex and costly healthcare system, one that costs US employees over $1.2 trillion each year. Healthjoy has shown that it can deliver substantial cost savings to employers while simplifying the employee healthcare experience.;",https://tcrn.ch/2wz8Crh

The American tech giant today launched 100X100X100, a program aimed at business-to-business SaaS startups.Microsoft said Monday that 100X100X100 will bring together 100 companies and 100 early and growth-stage startups. Each committed company will spend $100,000 over a course of 18 months.“This initiative will help build scale and create amazing opportunities for startups. Businesses can now fast-track their digital journeys through easy adoption of enterprise-grade solutions,” said Anant Maheshwari, President of Microsoft India, in a statement.Each startup participating in the program will also have access to prospective customers at Microsoft industry and customer events. Participants also get access to Microsoft’s technology platform and guidance in fine tuning their business and expansion models.Microsoft is not a new face in India’s startup ecosystem. The company runs Microsoft for Startups that allows early-stage B2B startups to use the company’s Azure marketplace and enterprise sales team. Early last year, the company also expanded M12, its corporate venture fund, to India.Google  and Amazon, Microsoft;s global rivals, are also actively helping startups in India, sponsoring countless events and bandying out a range of goodies including thousands of dollars of credit to use their cloud platforms.India;s Reliance Jio inks deal with Microsoft to expand Office 365, Azure to more businesses; unveils broadband, blockchain and IoT platformsThe idea is simple: If the bets work, these startups are already a customer and their solutions could be beneficial to several tens of thousands of other customers. And it;s a safe time to make these bets.In recent years, scores of startups have emerged in India to build SaaS software following the success of firms such as Freshworks, valued at $3.5 billion, and CleverTap. Since SaaS startups are not building hardware, or disbursing loans, they often have the best profit margin.Shekhar Kirani, a partner at Accel,  told TechCrunch in a recent interview that his biggest frustration was not seeing many more entrepreneurs build SaaS services. “Anyone with some coding skills and a cheap laptop can build a service and sell to the world,” he said.At a recent SaaS focused event, Godard Abel, chief executive of business marketplace G2, said that India was already among the top five nations for active participations for development of new business services.As for Microsoft, expect several more announcements this week as its chief executive, Satya Nadella,  appears at company;s flagship conference in the country today and tomorrow.",https://tcrn.ch/38SLSRj

Just subscribe here.] How well do Robinhood;s financials stack up against incumbent online brokerages? While we wait for the seven-year-old company;s long-planned IPO, Alex Wilhelm examined Morgan Stanley;s big $13 billion purchase of E-Trade for fresh data comparison points. Robinhood has 10 million accounts — twice what E-Trade has — but it also appears to make much less money per user and has far fewer assets under management, as he covered for Extra Crunch. So while its fee-free approach has destroyed a key revenue stream for competitors, it still has to grow its own ;order-flow; business into its private-market valuation.One solution is to make the platform stickier via social features. On the same day as the E-Trade deal announcement, Robinhood launched a new Profiles feature to encourage users to share stock tips. Josh Constine explored the offering and where it is headed on TechCrunch, concluding that ;Profiles and lists, and then eventually more social features, could get Robinhood’s users trading more so there’s more order flow to sell and more reason for them to buy subscriptions.;Alex also took a look at a new report on fintech funding, which found last year was a peak overall — but skewed towards later-stage companies. Certainly, the wealth management segment is looking mature.But the category is massive, with many more incumbents left to disrupt. What are fintech investors looking for? Check out our popular investor survey on this topic from November.How your startup can use TikTok for growthYou know that TikTok is where the cool kids are these days, but maybe; how do I say; it is not the social media platform you know best when it comes to growth.

The second part, for Extra Crunch subscribers, goes deep on how TikTok decides whose content gets featured more (and less).Fifth Wall’s Brendan Wallace: the proptech sector is hot despite WeWork;Our mandate is any technology that can be strategic to the real estate industry,; the prolific investor told Connie Loizos in an extended interview for Extra Crunch this week. While WeWork may have depressed some investor interest, plenty of models are working great across various segments — so he and his partners are raising more funds. One of the hottest sectors, perhaps surprisingly, is in sustainable buildings. As Wallace details, public pressure, large-tenant pressure, large-investor pressure and new metro requirements have removed any choice that the industry has in the matter:Make no mistake; we are front-and-center to what is happening in the real estate industry and the collision with technology, and this is the single-most-important thing that has happened to the real estate industry in the last five decades.

On the flip side, money pouring into Series B or beyond startups was at a record five-year high.Early-stage deals dropped to a 12-quarter low as deal share globally shifts to mid- and late-stages (CB Insights)Emerging and frontier markets were at the centre stage of most of the action: South America, Africa, Australia and Southeast Asia all topped their annual highs last year.Asia outpaced Europe in the second half of last year on both number of deals and bulk of capital raised. In Q3, European startups raised $1.6 billion through 95 deals, compared to $1.8 billion amassed by Asian startups across 157 deals. In Q4, a similar story was at play: European startups participated in 100 rounds to raise $1.2 billion, compared to $2.14 billion* raised by Asian startups across 125 deals*.Emergence of 24 new fintech unicorns in 2019: Eight fintech startups, including Next Insurance, Bight Health, Flywire, High Radius, Ripple and Figure, attained unicorn status in Q4 2019, and 16 others made it to the list throughout the rest of the last year.The fintech market globally had 67 unicorns as of earlier this month (CB Insights)Insurtech sector, or startups such as Lemonade, Hippo, Next, Wefox and Bright Health that are offering insurance services, got a major boost last year. They raised 6.2 billion last year, up from $3.2 billion in 2018.Startups building solutions such as invoicing and taxing services and payroll and payments solutions for small and medium businesses also received the nod of VCs. In the U.S. alone, where more than 140 startups are operating in the space, they raised $4 billion. In many more markets, such startups are beginning to emerge. In India, for instance, Open and NiYo are building neo-banks for small businesses, and they both raised money last year.Nearly 50% of all funding to fintech startups was concentrated in 83 mega-rounds (those of size $100 million or above): According to the research firm, 2019 was a record year for such rounds across the globe, except in Europe.2019 saw 83 mega-rounds totaling $17.2B, a record year in every market except EuropeFunding of Germany-based startups reached an annual high: 65 deals in 2019 resulted in $1.79 billion raised, compared to 56 deals and $757 million raised in 2018, and 66 deals and $622 million raised in 2017.Financial startups in Southeast Asia (SEA) raised $993 million across 124 rounds in 2019 in what was their best year.*CB Insights; report includes a $666 million financing round of Paytm .

1949601,2020-02-21T14:07:12,Investors in LatAm get bitten by the hotel investment bug as Ayenda raises $8.7 million,"Some of Latin America;s leading venture capital investors are now backing hotel chains.In fact, Ayenda, the largest hotel chain in Colombia, has raised $8.7 million in a new round of funding, according to the company.Led by Kaszek Ventures,  the round will support the continued expansion of Ayenda;s chain of hotels in Colombia and beyond. The hotel operator already has 150 hotels operating under its flag in Colombia and has recently expanded to Peru, according to a statement.Financing came from Kaszek Ventures and strategic investors like Irelandia Aviation, Kairos, Altabix and BWG Ventures.The company, which was founded in 2018, now has more than 4,500 rooms under its brand in Colombia and has become the biggest hotel chain in the country.Investments in brick and mortar chains by venture firms are far more common in emerging markets than they are in North America. The investment in Ayenda mirrors big bets that SoftBank Group  has made in the Indian hotel chain Oyo and an investment made by Tencent, Sequoia China, Baidu Capital and Goldman Sachs, in LvYue Group late last year, amounting to ;several hundred million dollars;, according to a company statement.“We;re seeking to invest in companies that are redefining the big industries and we found Ayenda, a team that is changing the hotel;s industry in an unprecedented way for the region;, said Nicolas Berman, Kaszek Ventures partner.Ayenda works with independent hotels through a franchise system to help them increase their occupancy and services. The hotels have to apply to be part of the chain and go through an up to 30-day inspection process before they;re approved to open for business.;With a broad supply of hotels with the best cost-benefit relationship, guests can travel more frequently, accelerating the economy,; says Declan Ryan, managing partner at Irelandia Aviation.The company hopes to have more than 1 million guests in 2020 in their hotels. Rooms list at $20 per-night, including amenities and an around the clock customer support team.Oyo;s story may be a cautionary tale for companies looking at expanding via venture investment for hotel chains. The once high-flying company has been the subject of some scathing criticism. As we wrote:The New York Times  published an in-depth report on Oyo, a tech-enabled budget hotel chain and rising star in the Indian tech community. The NYT wrote that Oyo offers unlicensed rooms and has bribed police officials to deter trouble, among other toxic practices.Whether Oyo, backed by billions from the SoftBank  Vision Fund, will become India’s WeWork is the real cause for concern. India’s startup ecosystem is likely to face a number of barriers as it grows to compete with the likes of Silicon Valley.",https://tcrn.ch/39VspzK
1949577,2020-02-21T10:35:07,Outdoor Voices founder Tyler Haney is stepping down as CEO as growth slows,"Tyler Haney,  the founder and chief executive of activewear label Outdoor Voices, has stepped down, the company confirmed for us this afternoon.The Business of Fashion, which first reported the news, said the transition follows a previously unreported capital injection from Outdoor Voices; investors at a lower valuation than previous rounds. It says the company tried raising new funding late last year but ;had difficulty.;We reached out to Haney directly earlier today, as well as board members from the venture firms that have backed the company, including General Catalyst and Forerunner Ventures.  In the meantime, the company sent us the following: ;As we look to grow and to scale, Tyler Haney has transitioned from her role as Chief Executive of Outdoor Voices  to a new position as Founder. We have raised another round of financing from our current investor group to support our growth and expansion moving forward. Tyler will remain a member of the Board of Directors and will assist with the search for a new CEO. Until we fill that role, Cliff Moskowitz will serve as the Company’s Interim CEO.”Moskowitz comes from InterLuxe, a kind of private equity firm that works with fashion and luxury brands where he has served as president for the last six years, according to his LinkedIn profile.BoF cites executive turnover as an earlier indicator that not all was well within the company, suggesting that mismanagement was one factor that prompted Pamela Catlett ; a former Nike and Under Armour exec ; to leave the company months after joining as president last year.Retail legend Mickey Drexler, formerly of J.Crew fame ; who was named chairman of Outdoor Voices; board in the summer of 2017 as part of a $9 million convertible debt round led by Drexler;s family office ; also resigned his position last year, though he maintained a director;s seat.Operational challenges aside, according to BoF, Outdoor Voices has had trouble replicating the kind of excitement that met its earliest offerings, including flattering, color-blocked athleisure wear, like leggings, sports bras, tees and tanks.The company has since rolled out an exercise dress that has gained traction with some consumers, but newer offerings meant to extend the brand;s reach, including solidly colored hoodies and terrycloth jogging pants that are less distinguishable from other offerings in the market, have apparently failed to boost sales.Indeed, according to the BoF report, the brand was losing up to $2 million per month last year on annual sales of around $40 million.The BoF story doesn;t mention the company;s brick-and-mortar locations and how they factor into the company;s narrative. But certainly, as with a growing number of direct-to-consumer brands that have been encouraged by their backers to open real-world locations, they;ve become a major cost center for the outfit. Outdoor Voices now has 11 locations around the U.S., including in Austin, LA, Soho in New York, Boston, Nashville, Chicago and Washington, D.C.Even with (at least) $64 million in funding that Outdoor Voices has raised from investors over the years, it;s also going head-to-head with very powerful, very entrenched and endurably popular brands, including Nike and Adidas. While Outdoor Voices is still in the fight, the shoe and apparel giants have vanquished plenty of upstarts over the years.What happens next to Haney ; a former track athlete from Boulder who first launched the business with a Parsons School of Design classmate ; isn;t yet clear. Still, she isn;t going far, reportedly. BoF says she still owns 10% of Outdoor Voices and will remain engaged with the company.Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly associated Moskowitz with a different Interluxe. Apologies for the confusion.Featured above, left to right, Emily Weiss of Glossier and Tyler Haney of Outdoor Voices at a 2017 Disrupt event.",https://tcrn.ch/2wutH6a
1949406,2020-02-21T10:17:16,Do AI startups have worse economics than SaaS shops?,"A few days ago, Andreessen Horowitz;s Martin Casado and Matt Bornstein published an interesting piece digging into the world of artificial intelligence (AI) startups, and, more specifically, how those companies perform as businesses. Core to the argument presented is that while founders and investors are wagering ;that AI businesses will resemble traditional software companies,; the well-known venture firm is ;not so sure.;Given that TechCrunch cares a lot about startup business fundamentals, the notion that one oft-discussed and well-funded category of venture-backed startup might sport materially less attractive economics than we expected captured our attention.The Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) perspective is straightforward, arguing that AI-focused companies have lesser gross margins than software companies due to cloud compute and human-input costs, endure issues stemming from ;edge-cases; and enjoy less product differentiation from competing companies when compared to software concerns. Today, we;re drilling into the gross margin point, as it;s something inherently numerical that we can get other, informed market participants to weigh in on.If a16z is correct about AI startups having slimmer gross margins than SaaS companies, they should — all other things held equal — be worth less per dollar of revenue generated; or in simpler terms, they should trade at a revenue multiple discount to SaaS companies, leaving the latter category of technology company still atop the valuation hierarchy.This matters, given the amount of capital that AI-focused startups have raised.Is a16z correct about AI gross margins? I wanted to find out. So this week I spoke to a number of investors from firms that have made AI-focused bets to get a handle on their views. Read the full a16z piece, mind. It;s interesting and worth your time.Today we;re hearing from Rohit Sharma of True Ventures, Jeremy Kaufmann of Scale Venture Partners, Nick Washburn of Intel Capital and Ben Blume of Atomico. We;ll start with a digest of their responses to our questions, with their unedited notes at the end.AI economics and optimismWe asked our group of venture investors (selected with the help of research from TechCrunch;s Arman Tabatabai) three questions. The first dealt with margins themselves, the second dealt with resulting valuations and, finally, we asked about their current optimism interval regarding AI-focused companies.",https://tcrn.ch/2HLUwoO
1949461,2020-02-21T08:14:37,DSP Concepts raises $14.5M for its Audio Weaver platform,"DSP Concepts — a startup whose Audio Weaver software is used by companies as varied as Tesla, Porsche, GoPro and Braun Audio — is announcing that it has raised $14.5 million in Series B funding.The startup;s goal, as explained to me by CEO Chin Beckmann and CTO Paul Beckmann (yep, they;re a husband-and-wife founding team), is to create the standard framework that companies use to develop their audio processing software.To that end, Chin told me they were ;picky about who we wanted on the B round, we wanted it to represent the support and endorsement of the industry.;So the round was led by Taiwania Capital,  but it also includes investments from the strategic arms of DSP Concepts;  industry partners — BMW i Ventures (which led the Series A), the Sony Innovation Growth Fund by Innovation Growth Ventures, MediaTek Ventures, Porsche Ventures and the ARM IoT Fund.Paul said Audio Weaver started out as the ;secret weapon; of the Beckmanns; consulting business, which he could use to ;whip out; the results of an audio engineering project. At a certain point, consulting customers started asking him, ;Hey, how about you teach me how to use that?,; so they decided to launch a startup focused on the Audio Weaver platform.Paul described the software as a ;graphical block diagram editor.; Basically, it provides a way for audio engineers to combine and customize different software modules for audio processing.;Audio is still in the Stone Ages compared to other industries,; he said. ;Suppose you’re building a product with a touchscreen — are you going write the graphics from scratch or use a framework like Qt?;Similarly, he suggested that while many audio engineers are still ;down in the weeds writing code,; they can take advantage of Audio Weaver;s graphical interface to piece everything together, as well as the company;s ;hundreds of different modules — pre-written, pre-tested, pre-optimized functions to build up your system.;For example, Paul said that by using the Audio Weaver platform, DSP Concepts engineers could test out ;hundreds of ideas; for algorithms to reduce wind noise in the footage captured by GoPro cameras, then ultimately ;hand the algorithms over to GoPro,; whose team could then plug the algorithms into their software and modify it themselves.The Beckmanns said the company also works closely with chip manufacturers to ensure that audio software will work properly on any device powered by a given chipset.Other modules include TalkTo, which is designed to give voice assistants like Alexa ;super-hearing,; so that they can still isolate voice commands and cancel out all the other noise in loud environments, even rock concerts. (You can watch a TalkTo demo in the video below.)DSP Concepts has now raised more than $25 million in total funding.&nbsp;",https://tcrn.ch/2T1ssDa
1949116,2020-02-21T06:02:55,Equity is not always the answer,"Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.This week was a fun combination of early-stage and late-stage news, with companies as young as seed stage and as old as PE-worthy joining our list of topics.Danny and Alex were back on hand to chat once again. Just in case you missed it, they had some fun talking Tesla yesterday, and there are new Equity videos on YouTube. Enjoy!Here;s what the team argued about this week:HungryPanda raises $20 million from 83North and Felix Capital. With a focus on Chinese food, Chinese language users and Chinese payment options like Alipay, it;s a neat play. According to TechCrunch, the service is live in 31 cities in the U.K., Italy, France, Australia, New Zealand and the U.S and is targeting $200 million in GMV by early Summer.The Org raises $8.5 million, ChartHop raises $5 million. Hailing from two different product perspectives, these two org chart-focused companies both raised capital Thursday morning. That made them interesting to Alex as they formed yet another startup cluster, and Danny was transfixed by their differing starting points as businesses, positing that they will possibly move closer to each other over time.DigitalOcean;s $100 million debt raise. The round — an addition of capital to a nearly profitable, SMB-focused cloud infra provider — split our hosts, with one leaning more toward a PE-exit and the other an IPO. Whether it can drive margins in the smaller-spend cloud customer segment will be critical to watch in the coming months.(For more on venture debt writ large, head here.)And finally, the E-Trade sale to Morgan Stanley, and what it might mean for Robinhood;s valuation. As Danny points out, the startup has found a good business in selling the order flow of its customers. Alex weighed in that the company has more revenue scaling to do before it grows into its last private valuation. So long as the market stays good, however, Robinhood is probably in good shape.Equity is nearly three years old, and we have some neat stuff coming up that you haven;t heard about yet.

1948945,2020-02-21T06:00:42,Where top VCs are investing in manufacturing and warehouse robotics,"Robotics and automation tools are now foundational parts of warehouses and manufacturing facilities around the world. Unlike many other robotics and AI use cases, the technology has moved well beyond the theoretical into practice and is used by small suppliers and large companies like Amazon and Walmart.There’s no doubt that automation will transform every step of the supply chain, from manufacturing to fulfillment to shipping and logistics. The only question is how long such a revolution will take.There’s still plenty of market left to transform and lots of room for new players to redefine different verticals, even with many of the existing leaders having already staked their claim. Naturally, VCs are plenty eager to invest millions in the technology. In 2019 alone, manufacturing, machinery and automation saw roughly 800-900 venture-backed fundraising rounds, according to data from Pitchbook and Crunchbase, close to two-thirds of which were still early-stage (pre-seed to Series B) investments.With our 2020 Robotics+AI sessions event less than two weeks away, we’ve decided to perform temperature checks across some of the hottest robotics sub-verticals to see which trends are coming down the pipe and where checks are actually being written. Just as we did with construction robotics last week, this time, we asked seven leading VCs who actively invest in manufacturing automation robotics to share what’s exciting them most and where they see opportunities in the sector:Rohit Sharma, True VenturesAjay Agarwal, Bain Capital VenturesRick Prostko, Comcast VenturesFatima Husain, Comcast VenturesShahin Farshchi, Lux CapitalCyril Ebersweiler, SOSV &amp; HAXKelly Coyne, Grit VenturesTC Sessions: Robotics + AI 2020Rohit Sharma, True VenturesWhich trends are you most excited about in manufacturing/warehouse automation robotics from an investing perspective?",https://tcrn.ch/2HLlLA1

The German electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft maker announced €50 million ($54 million at today;s exchange rate) in funding at the time, and the C round has now grown to €87 million ($94 million) thanks to new lead investor DB Schenker, a German logistics company with operations all over the world.This round also includes participation by Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Group, as well as the venture arm of its parent MS&amp;AD, along with TransLink Capital . Existing investors, including Lukasz Gadowski and btov, also participated in this round extension.With this new funding, Volocopter brings its total raised to around $132 million, and it says it will use the newly acquired capital to help certify its VoloCity aircraft, its air taxi eVTOL designed to transport people, which is on track to become the company;s first-ever vehicle licensed for commercial operation. Meanwhile, Volocopter will also use the new funds to help continue development of a next-generation iteration of its VoloDrone, which is the cargo-carrying version of its aircraft. It aims to use VoloDrone to expand its market to include logistics, as well as construction, city infrastructure and agriculture.Already, Volocopter has formed partnerships with companies including John Deere for pilots of its VoloDrone, but it says that a second-generation version of the vehicle will help it commercialize the drone. On the VoloCity side, the company recently flew a demonstration flight in Singapore, and then announced they;d be working with Grab on a feasibility study about air taxi services for potential deployment across Southeast Asia in key cities.Alongside this round extension, Volocopter adds two advisory board members ; Yifan Li from Geely Holding Group, which led the first tranche of this round closed in September, and DB Schenker  CEO Jochen Thewes. Both of these are key strategic partners from investors who stand to benefit the company not only in terms of funding, but also in terms of supply-side and commercialization.",https://tcrn.ch/2HL9tHH
1948821,2020-02-21T01:00:14,"Tier Mobility, the European e-scooter rentals startup, adds another ~$40M to its Series B","Tier, the European e-scooter rentals startup that operates in 55 cities across 11 countries, has topped up its funding for the second time in four months.The Berlin-based company has extended its Series B round to over $100 million, up from $60 million disclosed in October. The additional capital is a mix of equity and debt financing provided by Moscow;s RTP Global, London;s Novator and an unnamed U.S. debt fund. Part one of the Series B was co-led by Mubadala Capital and Goodwater Capital.Tier says the additional funds will be invested in R&amp;D in order to create further efficiency and for vehicle development. The so-called ;micromobility; startup will also continue to strengthen its management team ; the company recently recruited a new CCO and COO ; and pursue M&amp;A activities.In addition, Tier says it will expand its vehicle fleet ; perhaps with new micromobility product categories ; in order to bring ;sustainable mobility to more people and more cities across Europe.;Meanwhile, in January, Tier quietly acquired U.K. startup Pushme Bikes, a manufacturer of replaceable batteries and other mobility-related hardware. The company was thought to be developing a network of battery change stations for ;last-mile; transport, which would seem to tie directly into Tier;s recent move to upgrade its scooter fleet with new scooters that use swappable batteries.In a brief WhatsApp call with Tier co-founder and CEO Lawrence Leuschner, he framed the purchase of Pushme Bikes as an ;acqui-hire; based on the team;s design and development expertise, which he said will give Tier a needed boost in its future hardware plans.He also said that Tier;s move to swappable battery-based e-scooters has already seen 80% of its fleet replaced with scooters using swappable battery technology, which in turn is helping drive much better unit economics. That;s because the scooters no longer need to be taken off the streets and driven by van to a central location for charging and maintenance, only to be driven back several hours later. Instead, on-location maintenance where possible is carried out and dead batteries are simply swapped out and taken by cargo e-bike (pictured) to a central charging warehouse or, in some instances, a nearby charging ;hub.;Noteworthy, unlike the majority of e-scooter rental companies, Tier shunned gig economy workers for charging from the get-go, preferring to use a centralised system in order to maintain quality of service. ;The gig economy is dead [in relation to e-scooter rentals],; Leuschner says emphatically, noting that swappable battery tech means a centralised system makes even greater sense.And in case you;re wondering what Tier did with its old e-scooters after replacing most of its fleet with newer hardware, Leuschner explained that the Okai-manufactured devices are being re-sold directly to German consumers for private use via MyTier app. Perhaps that;s unsurprising, given that the Tier CEO previously founded reBuy, a European market leader in used electronics.Cue statement from Anton Inshutin, partner at RTP Global: “We were impressed by the team’s meticulous focus on capital efficiency and enhancing operational excellence. They have managed to deliver class-leading unit economics, enabling them to expand profitably in the winter. We are very much looking forward to partnering with this impressive team that is unrivalled in its execution as the company continues to scale.;Bird confirms acquisition of Berlin scooter rival Circ",https://tcrn.ch/37IoKDL

Lemnos Labs and Acario Innovation also participated in the round.Electriphi;s  pitch has resonated with school districts. It counts the Twin Rivers Unified School District in Sacramento, Calif. as one of its benchmark customers.;Twin Rivers Unified School District has the largest fleet of electric school buses in North America, and our ambition is to transition to a fully electric fleet in the coming years,” said Tim Shannon, transportation services director, Twin Rivers Unified School District, in a statement. “This is a significant undertaking, and we needed a trusted partner that could provide us state-of-the-art charging management and help us with data collection and monitoring.”There are several companies pursuing this market ; all with either a bit of a head start, significant corporate backers or more capital. Existing offerings from EVConnect, GreenLots, GreenFlux, AmplyPower all compete with Electriphi.The company is betting that the experience of co-founder Muffi Ghadiali, a former senior director at ChargePoint  who led hardware and software development for fast charging infrastructure, can sway customers. Joining Ghadiali is Sanjay Dayal, who previously worked at Agralogics, Tibco, Xamplify, Versata and Sybase . There;s also the sheer scale of the opportunity, which is likely to see multiple companies emerge as winners.“There are millions of public and commercial fleet vehicles in the U.S. alone that we rely on daily for transportation, delivery and services,” said Paul Straub,  managing partner, Wireframe Ventures. “Many of these are beginning to consider electrification and the opportunity is tremendous.;",https://tcrn.ch/2SJBiqk
1946155,2020-02-20T20:22:34,"At Tock, this restaurant group owner and former trader is building a Spotify for reservations","Tock, a six-year-old, Chicago-based culinary reservation service, has never had the kind of brand-recognition that other companies in the space have enjoyed, from publicly traded OpenTable to Resy, the New York-based company that was founded in 2014 and acquired last year for undisclosed terms by American Express.That;s because Tock  has relatively quietly been supporting customers, many of them high-end restaurants like French Laundry that, with Tock;s encouragement, began selling prepaid ;tickets; for meals years ago. These aren;t unlike buying tickets to a concert or NBA game, sometimes weeks or even many months in advance.Yet the reach of Tock appears to be growing. Late last month, in an interview with this editor, founder Nick Kokonas  said the platform has been processing $2 million a day in these pre-paid tickets. He insists that by rethinking the reservations process for higher-end spots, Tock has drastically reduced both wasted food and no shows. As he said during our sit-down, ;If you think about it, if you;re going to buy a ticket to the Rose Bowl and see a game, and suddenly your dog gets sick and you;ve got to go to the vet, you do not call the Rose Bowl and say, ;I;m really sorry, I can;t make it tonight. Give me my money back.; ;Tock has since announced a partnership with Chase, a partner of two years that just expanded its tie-up with Tock such that Chase Sapphire, Freedom and link cardholders will now have access to a dining page within the Chase mobile app that, driven by Tock, enables cardholders to browse, book and pay ahead for dining experiences at restaurants, bars, pop-ups and wineries. (It gives Tock, which says it already had 10 million users, another ;30 million households at once,; said Kokonas.)That bit of momentum begs the question of whether Tock ; which is backed with $17 million from Origin Ventures, Valor Equity Partners and others ; might go the Resy route and itself become part of a credit card giant. But Kokonas ; a hyphenate who also co-owns a prominent restaurant group that includes the famed Alinea in Chicago ; suggests he;s inclined to keep building the business for now. He has too many ideas of where to take it, including turning Tock into a kind of Spotify that recommends and customizes booking experiences for diners around the world.More from our sit-down, at the Upfront Summit last month, follows, lightly edited for length and clarity. It was an interesting conversation, particularly for anyone fascinated with the evolution of the restaurant industry over the last 15 years and how tech is changing it.TC: We;re both Greek Americans [and many Greeks used to open restaurants when they came to the U.S.]. My family had restaurants. Your father had a diner. But you didn;t jump into the restaurant business right away. NK: I had the usual where I started a derivatives trading firm right out of college because I was a philosophy major. That;s really important. I did that for 11 years, built that through about 100 employees. Then I met Grant Achatz, the chef who, if you want to learn more about him, check out Netflix;s ;Chef;s Table; [or the documentary] ;Spinning Plates.; He had tongue cancer and a very incredible outcome. He;s still 10 years cancer-free. But I met him when he was very young and he was the same kind of person who I would want to hire in my trading firm. It was more about backing a great person.Grant was doing what I think we all try to do anytime we build anything. He was doing something that;s emotionally resonant with consumers [at the restaurant where he was working at the time]. So you would go in there and you;d have this incredible experience; I felt like I knew how to build businesses. I started investing in the internet 1996. And I just said to him ;One day if you ever want to do something more than this, let me know.; And he said, ;Well, what kind of restaurant do you want to build?; and I said, ;How should I know? I;ve never built a restaurant before. But I want to make it great.; And so, I knew nothing about it, and then a year to the day later of that conversation we opened Alinea.TC: And;NK: I remember on the first day I thought I was done. It was kind of like a film production, where you produce the film, and then people can watch it. But of course, with the restaurant, you;re making art every day that people consume. It;s one of the only art forms or forms of entertainment that;s consumable. I remember [Grant] just grabbed me by the tie that opening night and said, ;Go over table 40 and make sure that [the wait staff is] doing it the right way.; Sixteen years later I have six restaurants and about 300 employees between Chicago and New York. And what I learned when I actually started running the restaurant when Grant got sick was that no one else knew anything about running a restaurant, either. It;s one of those areas where tradition exceeds expertise, and the software for it was built in a way that looked like 1998.TC: How so?So in 2005, an OpenTable salesman would come literally with a briefcase and [with its legacy reservation system], say, ;Look at this bad boy; I could leave it here for you today.; And that;s kind of what they still do.I came from a trading organization where we could process hundreds of thousands of transactions without a problem, yet in 2005 [when we opened Alinea], I couldn;t even know who my customers were; that was held from me [by OpenTable], and whenever I see opaque information, I see an arbitrage [opportunity].[I wanted a way to] look up every single thing that you eat and what you liked and what you didn;t like and left on the table, and your wife or spouse likes to drink. We were doing that in a very real way [in house, but] we couldn;t share that information with our other restaurants. [That information was] siloed on purpose because of the business model of OpenTable and Booking.com. So I started building it for myself.I remember [famed restaurateur] Danny Meyer telling me, ;You;ll never sell a ticket to a restaurant, I thought of it 20 years ago. It won;t work.; But we process about $2 million a day now in pre-paid tickets [beginning with what I built in 2010] by myself with one programmer. It was a very rudimentary system, and we sold $562,000 of tickets in the first day.TC: What is a ticket?NK: There are three kinds of reservations that you make in the world. There are free reservations, like ordinary reservations. There are times when you have to put a deposit down, and there are times that you pre-pay. [Regarding the last], when you think about it, if you;re going to buy a ticket to the Rose Bowl and see a game and suddenly your dog gets sick and you;ve got to go to the vet, you do not call the Rose Bowl and say, ;I;m really sorry, I can;t make it tonight. Give me my money back.; They play the game without you.With restaurants where demand exceeds supply by two or three times, there;s an opportunity to charge, like a movie or concert or some other form of entertainment. And that;s what was going through my head [at the start of Alinea] because we;re running 8% no show rates; we had [staff] answering the phone every day, disappointing people, telling people ;no; when they wanted [ a reservation] at seven o;clock on a Saturday. It;s like walking into a sweater store and [asking] ;Do you have a black cardigan?; [and being told] ;Nope, try again.;I just knew that I needed to solve my own problem. And now we;ve got 100 employees building all sorts of different iterations of dynamic and variable pricing for time-slotted businesses. Pricing will be differentiated in real time.TC: What is that sales process like [when it comes to your software and this ticket idea?] Do restaurants see it as a big gamble? Do they want to try it first for some period of time?NK: Any time you;re ripping and replacing a system that;s been around for 20 or 30 years, you have some convincing to do. The crossing-the-chasm thing is real. The first couple of years, we;d add 15, 20 restaurants a month, and we had to learn, really quickly, that they were either really great and had high demand, or they were failing and willing to try anything. So you had to really learn to pick your the right customers when you were early in the process.Now what;s happening is that we built out a system that is cloud based ; we;re the only independent system left [of meaningful scale] ; and we built it for enterprise. So we have 400 API endpoints. We can integrate with Salesforce. But we can also do specialty integrations with, you know, Vail Resorts, which is now a client of ours.So all of that now is going laterally and we;re getting the halo effect. We spend very little on marketing to businesses. We spend an awful lot of money now [on] building out that consumer network, [which the Chase deal should help with meaningfully]. The cool part about that news is that every single one of those people in the largest rewards program in the country is going to get an account. So that;s how I get 30 million U.S. households all at once.TC: What other ways are you sharing your customer data?NK: One of the most important pieces of data within a restaurant group that we don;t share across, is that we want to know your preferences, your dietary restrictions, your spouse;s birthday ; all those things. Those are for better hospitality. Now, for the next step we want you to give us that information. We already know your dining history ; why is there no platform like Spotify or Netflix for restaurants that anticipates your needs, knows what you enjoy and suggests little nudges to you [like], ;Hey, your anniversary is coming up in a little while ; maybe you should book something now, and we;ve got these great five choices that are in your (playlist).; So that mass personalization for the consumer is coming, that;s something that we;re building. You have to get to a point where you have enough of that data to do it well enough that it;s meaningful, but we;re there now.TC: The restaurant industry is brutally competitive. Is there a chance that some of your restaurants maybe don;t want to be part of a suggested rotation alongside other restaurants?NK: We don;t know. We haven;t done it yet.You know, restaurants are incredibly myopic in the sense that I don;t care how good you are, they are concerned that, when I turn on bookings from March, I hope we have customers. It;s a really weird business that way. And what we;re going to be able to do is that because of some of the data and people indicating interest before the reservations are available, we get to show the restaurant the elasticity of their demand before they actually put those bookings on. That;s incredibly powerful because now, for the first time, they can know they can project out months into the future what their demand will look like.TC: You;re working with restaurants and wineries and the like. What;s the vision? Are you going to be getting into other verticals within hospitality or beyond?We;ve experimented with other verticals; we;re focused on hospitality. We;re in 30 countries organically already. It;s a huge, huge space. But you know, if I was left to my own devices and didn;t have people managing me, I;d already have dentists using it.",https://tcrn.ch/2HIHjgw
1949290,2020-02-20T18:12:45,Here;s our pick of the top six startups from Pause Fest,"We’ve been dropping into the Australian startup scene increasingly over the years as the ecosystem has been building at an increasingly faster pace, most notably at our own TechCrunch Battlefield Australia in 2017. Further evidence that the scene is growing has come recently in the shape of the Pause Fest conference in Melbourne. This event has gone from strength to strength in recent years, and it is fast becoming a must-attend for Aussie startups aiming for both national international attention.I was able to drop in virtually to interview a number of those showcased in the Startup Pitch Competition, so here;s a run-down of some of the stand-out companies.Medinet AustraliaMedinet Australia is a health-tech startup aiming to make healthcare more convenient and accessible to Australians by allowing doctors to do consultations with patients via an app. Somewhat similar to apps like Babylon Health, Medinet;s telehealth app allows patients to obtain clinical advice from a GP remotely; access prescriptions and have medications delivered; access pathology results; directly email their medical certificate to their employer; and access specialist referrals along with upfront information about specialists such as their fees, waitlist, and patient experience. They’ve raised $3M in Angel financing and are looking for institutional funding in due course. Given Australia’s vast distances, Medinet is well-placed to capitalize on the shift of the population towards much more convenient telehealth apps. (1st Place Winner)EvertyEverty allows companies to easily manage, monitor and monetize Electric Vehicle charging stations. But this isn’t about infrastructure. Instead, they link up workplaces and accounting systems to the EV charging network, thus making it more like a “Salesforce  for EV charging.; It;s available for both commercial and home charging tracking. It’s also raised an Angel round and is poised to raise further funding. (2nd Place Winner)AI On SpectrumIt’s a sad fact that people with Autism statistically tend to die younger, and unfortunately, the suicide rate is much higher for Autistic people. “AI on Spectrum” takes an accessible approach in helping autistic kids and their families find supportive environments and feel empowered. The game encourages Autism sufferers to explore their emotional side and arms them with coping strategies when times get tough, applying AI and machine learning in the process to assist the user. (3rd Place Winner.)HiveKeeperProfessional bee-keepers need a fast, reliable, easy-to-use record keeper for their bees and this startup does just that. But it’s also developing a software and sensor technology to give beekeepers more accurate analytics, allowing them to get an early-warning about issues and problems. Their technology could even, in the future, be used to alert for coming bushfires by sensing the changed behavior of the bees. (Hacker Exchange Additional Winner.)RelectrifyRechargeable batteries for things like cars can be re-used again, but the key to employing them is being able to extend their lives. Relectrify says its battery control software can unlock the full performance from every cell, increasing battery cycle life. It will also reduce storage costs by providing AC output without needing a battery inverter for both new and 2nd-life batteries. Its advanced battery management system combines power and electric monitoring to rapidly the check which are stronger cells and which are weaker making it possible to get as much as 30% more battery life, as well as deploying ;2nd life storage;. So far, they have a project with Nissan and American Electric Power and have raised a Series A of $4.5 million. (SingularityU Additional Winner.)GabrielSadly, seniors and patients can contract bedsores if left too long. People can even die from bedsores. Furthermore, hospitals can end up in litigation over the issue. What’s needed is a technology that can prevent this, as well as predicting where on a patient;s body might be worst affected. That’s what Gabriel has come up with: using multi-modal technology to prevent and detect both falls and bedsores. Its passive monitoring technology is for the home or use in hospitals and consists of a resistive sheet with sensors connecting to a system which can understand the pressure on a bed. It has FDA approval, is patent-pending and is already working in some Hawaiian hospitals. It’s so far raised $2 million in Angel and is now raising money.Here’s a taste of Pause Fest:",https://tcrn.ch/39STFyU
1948532,2020-02-20T16:34:52,How much should a startup spend on security?,"One of the questions I frequently ask startup founders is how much they;re spending on security. Unsurprisingly, everyone has a different answer.Startups and small companies are invariably faced with the prospect that they;re either not spending enough or are spending too much on something that;s hard to quantify in terms of value. It;s a tough sell to sink money into an effort to stop something that might one day happen, particularly for bootstrapped startups that must make every cent count ; yet we;re told security is a crucial investment for a company;s future.Sorry to break it to you, but there is no easy answer.The reality is that each company is different and there is no single recommended dollar amount to spend. But it;s absolutely certain that some investment is required. We know because we see a lot of security incidents here at TechCrunch — hacks, breaches and especially data exposures, often a result of human error.We spoke to three security experts — a head of security, a security entrepreneur and a cybersecurity fellow — to understand the questions facing startups.Know and understand your threat modelEvery company has a different threat model — by that, we mean identifying risks and possible ways of attack before they happen. Companies that store tons of user data may be a greater target than companies that don;t. Each firm needs to evaluate which kind of risks they face and identify weaknesses.",https://tcrn.ch/2PeUQAO

1947000,2020-02-20T14:42:54,SpaceX alumni are helping build LA;s startup ecosystem,"During the days when Snapchat;s popularity was booming, investors thought the company would become the anchor for a new Los Angeles technology scene.Snapchat, they hoped, would spin-off entrepreneurs and angel investors who would reinvest in the local ecosystem and create new companies that would in turn foster more wealth, establishing LA as a hub for tech talent and venture dollars on par with New York and Boston.In the ensuing years, Los Angeles and its entrepreneurial talent pool has captured more attention from local and national investors, but it;s not Snap that;s been the source for the next generation of local founders. Instead, several former SpaceX  employees have launched a raft of new companies, capturing the imagination and dollars of some of the biggest names in venture capital.;There was a buzz, but it doesn’t quite have the depth of bench of people that investors wanted it to become,; says one longtime VC based in the City of Angels. ;It was a company in LA more than it was an LA company.; Perhaps the most successful SpaceX offshoot is Relativity Space, founded by Jordan Noone and Tim Ellis. Since Noone, a former SpaceX engineer, and Ellis, a former Blue Origin engineer, founded their company, the business has been (forgive the expression) a rocket ship. Over the past four years, Relativity has raised $185.7 million, received special dispensations from NASA to test its rockets at a facility in Mississippi, will launch vehicles from Cape Canaveral and has signed up an early customer in Momentus, which provides satellite tug services in orbit.",https://tcrn.ch/2wCi8u1
1949166,2020-02-20T14:08:52,Shogun raises $10M to help e-commerce brands build faster websites,"Amazon may have a market cap of more than $1 trillion, but Finbarr Taylor, CEO of Y Combinator-backed startup Shogun, said the e-commerce giant is ;kind of dropping the ball.;Specifically, he argued that the experience of shopping on Amazon — not what happens after you buy something, but browsing the website itself — is pretty bad, full of sponsored results and fake products.;What we’re seeing happen is that all this vast wave of direct-to-consumer brands is nibbling around edges of Amazon and beating them on buying experience,; Taylor said.Shogun  was designed to support those brands. Taylor and his co-founder Nick Raushenbush created the first product in 2015, and they treated it as a side project at first. But Taylor said that by May 2017, ;It ate up all of our free time and it was obviously much bigger than we expected,; so they quit their jobs (Taylor was working as a software engineer at Y Combinator)  and devoted themselves to it full-time.The company now has 11,000 customers, including MVMT, K-Swiss and Leesa. And today, Shogun is announcing that it has raised a $10 million Series A, led by Initialized Capital,  with participation from VMG Partners and YC. (The startup has now raised a total of $12 million.)The company;s first product, Page Builder, offers a drag-and-drop interface to make it easier for e-commerce brands to build their storefronts on Shopify, BigCommerce, Salesforce and Magento.And there;s a new product, Shogun Frontend, which allows brands to create a web storefront that;s entirely customized while still using one of the big commerce platforms as their back end.Taylor pitched this as part of a broader trend toward ;headless commerce,; where the e-commerce front end and back end are handled separately. He suggested that this is a ;mutually beneficial; split, as Shopify and its competitors are going ;super deep; on building the infrastructure needed to operate a store online, while Shogun focuses on the actual experience of the customer visiting that store.Meanwhile, website builders like Squarespace and Weebly (owned by Square) have introduced e-commerce features, but Taylor suggested that they;re still ;not really a professional choice; for most e-commerce businesses.As one of the key features of Shogun Frontend, Taylor pointed to the fact that it creates progressive web apps that should be as fast and smooth as a native app.Brett Gibson, general partner at Initialized Capital and a Shogun board member, made a similar point in a statement:For DTC brands competing against goliaths like Amazon, Shogun Frontend now gives them features and capabilities once only reserved for enterprise companies. And when it comes to speed, Shogun Frontend;s sub-second load time is the critical difference between retaining or losing a customer.Taylor added that the company will be ;continuing to invest in Page Builder too,; but he suggested that Frontend is ;more of an enterprise offering; that can help Shogun;s biggest customers ;future proof themselves.;D2C companies deliver customer delight and simplicity",https://tcrn.ch/37KRXy7
1948664,2020-02-20T10:33:06,The rise of the winged pink unicorn,"										Claire Diaz-Ortiz						Contributor																Share on Twitter																Claire Diaz-Ortiz is an angel investor and bestselling author of nine books that have been published in more than a dozen countries. An early employee at Twitter, she was called “The Woman Who Got the Pope on Twitter” by Wired and holds an MBA and other degrees from Stanford and Oxford.						More posts by this contributor								Latin America takes the global lead in VC directed to female co-founders						Women are the secret ingredient in Latin America’s outsized returns							Like most investors, I am a little too obsessed with unicorns.But not just the Silicon Valley kind. As the mother of a five-year-old daughter, my interests also veer in a pink, sparkly direction. So it should not be all that surprising that I recently found myself in a dusty corner of the internet where die-hard unicorn fans go to spread their wings.It was there, deep in the My Little Pony forums, that one question stopped me in my tracks: “is a male alicorn possible in the future?1”An alicorn, for those uninitiated to the mythological particulars, is the rare winged, female version of a traditional unicorn.My Little Pony popularized the term, and the fan forum on which user “Green Precision” asked his question back in 2015 had some interesting answers to the particulars of this philosophical dilemma.Shadow Stallion responded immediately, “I don;t think a male Alicorn will be possible in the future. Not because its [sic] not wanted or because its [sic] not genetically possible;but generally when male characters are introduced to a show where female characters are prominent, things get ugly.”Malinter posited, “they probably do but given the female-to-male ratio of Equestria2 they are probably exceptionally rare. The real problem for a male alicorn is not that they exist but where is their place in the world? ;Our male alicorn has some pretty big hoof prints to fill in while at the same time not make a trainwreck of established lore.”Wind Chaser went straight from unconscious bias to conscious bias in their response: “aesthetically a male alicorn just wouldn;t look right, because their bodies are already naturally larger than females, thus the wings would cause an imbalance to the design.”But it wasn’t all bad news.“Until it;s proven otherwise, it;s safe to say that something like a male alicorn is possible,; responded Geek0zoid. Crysahis agreed. “Overall yes, I believe there could be a male alicorn it may just take a while to actually happen!”It doesn’t take a PhD in philosophy from Stanford or the one lone female investing partner at Sequoia3 to posit that these same conversations were probably happening all over Sandhill Road in December of 2009, as male VCs discussed whether female unicorns could actually happen4.As we move into 2020, though, we’re about to see a pink, winged stampede.Just look at the recent trends. In 2019, more female-funded unicorns were born than ever before.5 And things are only looking up. (I’m looking at you, ClassPass!)Public opinion agrees. Alongside TruePublic, where I am an advisor and angel investor, I ran a study asking if people believed we would see more female-led unicorns in the 2020s.6 At the time of this article, 68% of the 6,500 respondents said they believed we would see more, with 30% of women responding “many more” (as opposed to only 16% of men). Only 4% of women, but 9% of men, responded “no, not a chance.”7Kaben Clauson, founder and CEO, says ;to represent Gen Z, Millennials and Gen X, TruePublic needs a weighted sample of roughly one thousand Americans to represent that population of the USA.; This particular study already has 6,500 respondents, making it statistically significant.In fact, female-founded and female co-founded companies are actually over-indexing for unicorn status despite a lack of investment dollars.Shelby Porges, co-founder of The Billion Dollar Fund for Women, explains: “Recent tracking has shown that female-founded companies represent 4% of all unicorns. That;s astonishing considering that in the past couple of years, they have gotten only slightly more than 2% of all venture funding.” Porges, whose group has mobilized more than 80 venture funds to pledge to invest over a billion dollars into women-founded companies, continues, “It demonstrates why we say, ;when you invest in women, you;re in good company.; ;Here are the three reasons I believe a herd of winged female unicorns (OK, alicorns) is coming down the pipeline in the 2020s:1. Women invest in women at 3x the rate of menNew data reveals that women invest in women at nearly three times the rate that men do and with the (slow) rise in the number of female investing partners at VCV firms, we are poised to see more and more gender-balanced founding teams getting funding.8 Like one male GP at one of the world’s top VC funds said to me when discussing one of the few female partners at his firm, “she always brings us parenting companies.” It might be cringe-worthy if TechCrunch hadn’t declared 2020 “a big year for online childcare” and that same female partner weren’t about to make a big chunk of cash thanks to all the upcoming parenting alicorns she was smartly funding.Sophia Bendz, a partner at Atomico who also leads the Atomico Angel Program, said, “I’m confident we’ll see more female unicorns in the next decade because there’s a growing wave of ambitious female founders building incredible products and services. There are also more women in VC now and I’ve seen first-hand the impact having female investment partners can have on increasing the amount of investment into female-led companies. The data shows that women invest in women at three times the rate as male investment partners.”My study at TruePublic coincided with these findings. When asked if a female investor was more likely to invest in a female entrepreneur, 64% of people responded affirmatively (64% of these individuals were women and 63% were men).9Jomayra Herrera agrees. An investor at Cowboy Ventures (which thanks to Aileen Lee coined the term “unicorn” in the first place), and a volunteer with AllRaise, a nonprofit promoting women in VC, she says: “As the venture industry continues to diversify, especially as it relates to gender and race/ethnicity, I am optimistic that we will see more female-led and people of color-led unicorns over the next decade. We know that diverse teams not only function better, but they are able to see areas of opportunities that more homogenous teams might miss. I think the next generation of investors are more likely to question conventional wisdom, forms of pattern recognition that may lead to bias, and other structural barriers that have historically left out promising entrepreneurs.”Camila Farani is a well-known investor in Brazil. As founder of G2 Capital, former president of Gavea Angels and a personality on Brazil’s ;Shark Tank,; she says “having diverse points of view at the table makes the decision clearer and more certain. People who think differently than you and have other visions of the market, sometimes can show you what you can’t see by yourself.”She also reminds us not to forget the impact that angel investors can have. “The investments market is still made up mostly of men, but this landscape is changing gradually. It is interesting to see that angel investing is being the most common choice for women who want to make their first investments.”This trend of investing more in women isn’t just limited to female investors. Susana Robles has spent two decades leading the charge to invest in women in Latin America and alongside Marta Cruz of NXTP Labs is co-founder of WeXchange, a platform that connects women entrepreneurs from Latin America and the Caribbean with mentors and investors.As Robles says, “I think the world is finally waking up to the fact that there is serious research proving that startups with women co-founders win in all aspects: profitability, as well as greater social and environmental awareness. Investors should want to have this triple win.” She continues, “women tend to return money to investors faster than men, and at the same time, they obtain higher returns. Women are in charge of 64% of all global purchasing decisions on products and services, so having women on C-level positions increases the chance that a startup [will] be highly attractive to a massive market and become a unicorn.”It also extends to the LPs in the funds. “I also think many investors in funds (mostly DFIs [development finance institutions] but not exclusively) have become more vocal in stating that they don’t want any more to invest in teams led by an all-white, all-male cast who choose startups with all-white, all-male founders.” Jennifer Neundorfer is the co-founder of Jane VC and an investor in Kinside, a parenting app that just raised a $3 million seed round. When describing her fund’s rationale for focusing on female founders, she drops the mic: “we’re going to invest in an under-looked asset class that is overperforming.” Boom.2. Female founders are creating new billion-dollar marketsAnother reason we’ll see more female-founded “alicorns” in the 2020s has everything to do with the new markets that female founders are creating. Hunter Walk of Homebrew was one of the initial seed investors in Winnie, an online marketplace for childcare that recently raised a $9 million Series A. At the time, he saw something that others investors didn’t. Winnie co-founder Sara Mauskopf explains, “Four years ago when we started Winnie, parenting and especially child care were not hot investment areas. This has been changing. It certainly helps that more investors are women and are in the thick of their child-bearing and rearing years.;Part of what Walk says he recognized was the clear founder-market fit displayed by Mauskopf and her co-founder Annie Halsall. As Mauskopf says, “With Winnie, we saw an opportunity to solve the child-care crisis that other founders either did not recognize or did not care to solve. While everyone else was starting crypto and scooter companies, we were building the first-ever tech platform for $57 billion child care industry. Lack of access to quality child care disproportionately impacts women, so it shouldn;t be surprising that it took a female led team to capitalize on this opportunity.” Expanding on the concept of founder-market fit, Walk says, “I love to come away thinking, these are the absolute right founders to build this business.”10Bendz, the Atomico partner who specializes in femtech and is also an avid angel investor, agrees. “Often I meet founders that you can tell are at the right place at the right time with the right mindset and the right team. It’s almost like all of the experiences they have had prior to launching a company have been preparing them to create that business at that time. These are the kind of founders who I know are in it for the long haul, and who are going to weather the ups and downs.” As a woman who uses the products and services she invests in, Bendz is also an example of investor-market fit, which I believe will open new markets in the decades to come.Something else investors like Walk and Bendz believe in? Outsized opportunities. And the potential for outsized opportunities are especially ripe in untapped markets. The rise of femtech is yet another example of how the intuitive success of the concept of founder-market fit ultimately needed more female founders for certain markets to blossom. As Bendz explains, “Throughout a woman;s life there are many big events that have a big impact on our overall health ; from childbirth to menopause. I know all women are tired of poor or non-existent solutions for women surrounding those life events, and that’s why we are seeing so many companies launching to better serve women’s needs. When you think about the fact that women have only had the right to vote and educate themselves for 100 years, it’s mind-blowing how long the world was operating with only 50% of the population in control. That’s reflected in the products and services we as a society have funded.”Women’s consumer products are another area. Ornella Moraes is one of four female co-founders of Brazilian-led Sousmile, which recently raised a $6 million USD Series A led by Kaszek Ventures. “Our brand is a woman,” Moraes says of her dental beauty startup that retails throughout São Paulo. And so are the leaders of the company. At Sousmile, there are four female co-founders and two male co-founders. “More dentists in the world are women than men, so it’s been critical for our team to have more female founders,” she says. In this way, the rise of female founders and co-founders can completely change markets. ;We believe this will fundamentally create a different type of product,; says Walk.3. Emerging markets will take the leadFinally, certain emerging markets pose a particular opportunity for female founders by over-indexing for both large IPOs and female founders. 2017 was the first year that more of the largest IPOs in the internet sector globally came from emerging markets. Nazar Yasin, founder of Rise Capital, which invests in emerging markets, says “This trend isn’t going away.” After all, most GDP growth comes from emerging markets, where most global internet users live. As he explains, “the future of market capitalization growth in the internet sector globally belongs to emerging markets.” And yet this type of innovation takes resilience. “If you’re a startup in one of these markets, it’s like trying to grow a plant in the desert.”11 In an environment that demands more daily resilience, there is a different appetite for risk and innovation. (I call this resilience innovation.)Perhaps the easiest example of emerging market innovation fueled by resilience is fintech. Emerging markets and their often unstable economies boast a much higher number of frustratingly unbanked individuals. This brings about innovation. Hanna Schiuma, the Brazilian-born fintech founder of ElasBank, where I am an angel investor and advisor, explains how ubiquitous such fintech innovation is becoming.“Soon all finance will be tailor-made and fintech will be common ground because all financial services will be technology-intensive.” She also argues that the nature of such an innovation allows the industry to become more innovative, and thus inclusive, which is exactly what is happening with her own women’s bank, launching in 2020. “That means great opportunities to better serve women;s financial needs to offer dedicated products, and to gather female talent to build those products from a diverse and innovative perspective.” Ultimately, “resilience is key for us to build that pool of talent and open the doors for gender balance and financial inclusion.”Furthermore, data shows Africa and Latin America both beat global averages for percentages of startup female founders. Laura Stebbing is co-CEO of accelerateHER, a global community of leaders addressing the under-representation of women in tech through action. Raised in Southern Africa, Stebbing is passionate about Africa’s rise as a hub of female entrepreneurship.“Africa has both the highest proportion of women founders at 26% [Latam comes in second]12 and a $42 billion funding gap. There’s clearly no lack of talent across Africa’s 54 countries, so for the investors, corporate executives, policy makers and established founders that aren’t moved by the moral arguments for gender parity, notice the enormous business opportunity. We will start to see a higher volume of resilient, scalable companies emerge as leaders build more diverse networks and ecosystems that support women to unlock their entrepreneurial potential.” Nathan Lustig, founder of Magma Partners, a VC firm in Latin America which invests in female founders above the regional average, explains, “investing in and empowering resilient women entrepreneurs is just good business, and is one of the biggest investment opportunities, especially in emerging markets.”I believe Latin American can have an edge. I am a Silicon Valley-born investor now living in “Silicon Aires,” where I have been thrilled to see exciting numbers of female founders in Latin America. Susana Robles agrees, and says the reason is in part due to the nature of a committed ecosystem to support one another. “It’s the sheer need that forces you to collaborate.” An ecosystem like Silicon Valley doesn’t have the same need to do so. Of Latin America, Robles says, “In 10 years, we will have created a much more collaborative market than the developed ones.” And that collaboration is leading to great female founders. 2019, in fact, saw more funding going to female co-founders in Latin America than in Europe or the USA.13This will lead to future alicorns. Ann Williams, COO of Creditas, a Brazilian fintech currently closing in on its own unicorn status, says ;the conversion funnel for unicorns works just like any other selection process. We fill the top with a bunch of great women in supporting roles in emerging market startups, these women take their experiences and found rocking new companies. A percentage of these will convert to scaleups raising Series C and D rounds with valuations at $1 billion or higher. And voila! we get women-led unicorns.” She continues, “the odds are with us and I am sure the talent is too!”Juliane Butty, startup head at Platzi and former regional manager of Seedstars, one of the leading accelerators and investors fostering female entrepreneurship in emerging markets, joins Williams. ;We have definitely seen the rise of female founders and investors in emerging markets in the last decade. One supports the other. And we know that success breeds success.”Perhaps My Little Pony fan Malinter said it best when he suggested how a male version of the alicorn could finally emerge in such a female-dominated space: “The simplest way they could probably add one in would be to make said alicorn the ruler of a neighboring nation.” In the same way, emerging markets may just hold the key for female unicorns.No matter the region, Robles says “if we keep opening doors to women entrepreneurs who are as ambitious as men in growing their companies, we’ll begin to see many more unicorns with gender diversified teams.” Hanna Schiuma, the Elasbank founder who just might be building the next female-founded unicorn, agrees. “The alicorns are coming. And we’re ready to fly.”2Equestria is of course where the My Little Ponies and their assorted unicorns, alicorns and friends all live.3Go Jess Lee!4Yes, Aileen Lee of Cowboy VC first invented the term in her 2013 TechCrunch piece, but we’re in a unicorn-fueled time machine, people.8;Do Female Investors Support Female Entrepreneurs?

This additional funding was led by previous investors Norwest Venture Partners and Shasta Ventures. Kleiner Perkins, Canaan and Launchub also participated in this round, which the company says it will use to bolster its product development and go-to-market efforts. With this, Leanplum  has now raised a total of $125 million.Maybe just as importantly, Leanplum also announced a major shakeup of its executive ranks. The company appointed George Garrick as president and CEO, and Sheri Huston as chief financial officer. Co-founder and former CEO Momchil Kyurkchiev will step into the chief product officer role.Garrick brings a wealth of experience with him, having been the CEO of companies like Flycast, Placeware, Wine.com and Tapjoy . Huston, too, comes into the role with a lot of industry experience as the former CFO at Comscore and LiquiBox. The company is also adding Dynamic Signal  founder Russ Fradin  to its board of directors.The company describes the changes in its executive ranks as a ;transition.;;Many if not most startups at some point in their growth realize that a management transition makes sense as the requirements for the CEO evolve from starting and proving a company, to running and scaling it,; Garrick told us in a statement. ;Leanplum’s board and founders agreed that such a transition would be appropriate as Leanplum accelerates its growth phase.;This was echoed by Kyurkchiev: ;George is the right leader for Leanplum. His strong management experience with companies at our stage and in our domain will be essential for Leanplum as we continue to drive growth and expand globally.;Leanplum says about 2 billion people used apps and websites that use its services in 2019.As for the new funding, the company says it was simply easier to extend its Series D, which has the same investors as the original D round. ;The board felt it was easier and more appropriate to just extend the D round rather than move into the next letter. Also, we wanted to minimize ;letter creep,; ; Garrick said.",https://tcrn.ch/2SKkmQl
1948903,2020-02-20T08:04:15,"As Morgan Stanley buys E-Trade, Robinhood preps social trading","Before it was worth $7.6 billion, the original idea for Robinhood  was a stock-trading social network. At my kitchen table in San Francisco in 2013, the founders envisioned an app for sharing hot tips to a feed complete with a leaderboard of whose predictions were most accurate. Once they had SEC approval, they pivoted toward the real money maker: letting people buy and sell stocks in the app, and pay to borrow cash to do so.Now, seven years later, Robinhood is subtly taking the first steps back to its start. Today it;s launching Profiles. For now, they let users see analytics about their portfolio, like how concentrated they are in stocks versus options versus cryptocurrency, as well as across different business sectors. Complete with usernames and a photo, Profiles let you follow self-made or Robinhood-provided lists of stocks and other assets.Profiles could give Robinhood;s customers the confidence to trade more, and create a sense of lock-in that stops them from straying to other brokerages that have dropped their per-trade fees to zero to match the startup, like Charles Schwab, Ameritrade and E-Trade, which was acquired for $13 billion today by Morgan Stanley, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.The Profile features certainly sound helpful. They could reveal that your portfolio is too centered around tech, media and telecom stocks, or that you;re ignoring cryptocurrency or corporations from your home state. Lists also makes it easier to track specific business verticals, save stocks to buy when you have the cash or set aside some for deeper research. Robinhood pulls info from FactSet, Morningstar and other trusted sources to figure out which stocks and ETFs go into sector lists, or you can make and name your own. Profiles and lists begin to roll out to all users next week.But what;s most interesting is how profiles lay the foundation for Robinhood as a social network. It;s easy to imagine letting users follow other accounts or lists they create. The original Robinhood app let users make predictions like ;17% increase in Facebook share price over the next 11 weeks,; with comments to explain why. It showed users; prediction accuracy, their average holding time for assets, a point score for smart foresight and community BUY or SELL ratings on stocks.If Robinhood rebuilt some of these features, it might lessen the need for an expensive financial advisor or having enough cash to qualify for one with a different brokerage. Robinhood could let you crowdsource advice. “We understand the connotation of taking something from the rich and giving it to the poor. Robinhood is liberating information that’s locked up with professionals and giving it to the people,; Robinhood co-founder and co-CEO Vlad Tenev told me back in 2013.Robinhood would certainly need to be careful about scammy tips going viral. Improper safeguards could lead to pump and dump schemes where those late to buy in get screwed when prices snap back to reality.But embracing social could leverage some of its strongest assets: the youthfulness of its user base and the depth of connection to its users. The median age of a Robinhood customer is 30, and half say they;re first-time investors. Being able to turn to friends or experts within the app might convince them to pull the trigger on trades.Most online brokerages are somewhat undifferentiated beyond differences in pricing, while their clunky, unstylized products don;t generate the same brand affinity as people have for Robinhood. Unsatisfied users could bail for a competitor at any time. Robinhood;s users are accustomed to social networking and the way it locks in users, because they don;t want to abandon their community.When I asked Robinhood Profiles; product manager Shanthi Shanmugam directly about whether this was the start of more social trading features, they suspiciously dodged the question, telling me, ;When thinking about how to reflect who you are as an investor, we looked at how other apps represent you and it felt natural to leverage a design that felt more like a profile. When helping people group their investment ideas, it was easy to envision this as a playlist you might find on your favorite music app.;That;s far from a denial. Offering social validation for trading could help Robinhood earn more from its customers despite their small total account balances. While Robinhood might have more than 10 million accounts versus E-Trade;s 5.2 million and Morgan Stanley;s  3 million, E-Trade’s average account size is $69,230 and Morgan Stanley’s is $900,000, while a survey found most of Robinhood;s held $1,000 to $5,000.That all means that Robinhood earns less on interest sitting in users; accounts than the old incumbents. But Robinhood earns the majority of its money on selling order flow and through its subscription Robinhood Gold feature that lets users pay monthly so they can borrow cash to trade with. Profiles and lists, and then eventually more social features, could get Robinhood;s users trading more so there;s more order flow to sell and more reason for them to buy subscriptions.;Democratizing access is about lowering fees, minimums and other barriers people face ; like confidence. Profiles and lists make finance easier to understand and more familiar for people,; says Shanmugam. More social features built safely, more reassurance, more trading, more revenue. Robinhood has raised $910 million. But to outgun larger competitors like the newly assembled Morgan Stanley/E-Trade that;s matched its zero-fee pricing, Robinhood will have to win with product.What the $13B E-Trade deal says about Robinhood;s valuation",https://tcrn.ch/2SZgjyF

He left his previous job and spent the last couple of years building the kind of software he felt was missing in the market. ;ChartHop  is the first org management platform. It;s really a new type of HR software that brings all the different people data together in one place, so that companies can plan, analyze and visualize their organizations in a completely new way,; White told TechCrunch.While he acknowledges that among his early customers, the Head of HR is a core user, White doesn;t see this as purely an HR issue. ;It;s a problem for any executive, leader or manager in any organization that;s growing and trying to plan what the organization is going to look like more strategically,; he explained.Lead investor at a16z David Ulevitch, also sees this kind of planning as essential to any organization. ;How you structure and grow your organization has a tremendous amount of influence on how your company operates. This sounds so obvious, and yet most organizations don’t act thoughtfully when it comes to organizational planning and design,; Ulevitch wrote in a blog post announcing the investment.The way it works is that out of the box it connects to 15 or 20 standard types of company systems like BambooHR, Carta, ADP and Workday, and based on this information it can build an organizational chart. The company can then slice and dice the data by department, open recs, gender, salary, geography and so forth. There is also a detailed reporting component that gives companies insight into the current makeup and future state of the organization.The visual org chart itself is set up so that you can scrub through time to see how your company has changed. He says that while it is designed to hide sensitive information like salaries, he does see it as a way of helping employees across the organization understand where they fit and how they relate to other people they might not even know because the size of the company makes that impossible.ChartHop org chart organized by gender. Screenshot: ChartHopWhite says that he has dozens of customers already, who are paying ChartHop by the employee on a subscription basis. While his target market is companies with more than 100 employees, at some point he may offer a version for early-stage startups who could benefit from this type of planning, and could then have a complete history of the organization over the life of the company.Today, the company has 9 employees, and he only began hiring in the fall when this seed money came through.

1948315,2020-02-20T05:00:45,A group of ex-NSA and Amazon engineers are building a ;GitHub for data;,"Six months ago or thereabouts, a group of engineers and developers with backgrounds from the National Security Agency, Google and Amazon Web Services had an idea.Data is valuable for helping developers and engineers to build new features and better innovate. But that data is often highly sensitive and out of reach, kept under lock and key by red tape and compliance, which can take weeks to get approval. So, the engineers started Gretel, an early-stage startup that aims to help developers safely share and collaborate with sensitive data in real time.It;s not as niche of a problem as you might think, said Alex Watson, one of the co-founders. Developers can face this problem at any company, he said. Often, developers don;t need full access to a bank of user data — they just need a portion or a sample to work with. In many cases, developers could suffice with data that looks like real user data.;It starts with making data safe to share,; Watson said. ;There;s all these really cool use cases that people have been able to do with data.; He said companies like GitHub, a widely used source code sharing platform, helped to make source code accessible and collaboration easy. ;But there;s no GitHub equivalent for data,; he said.And that;s how Watson and his co-founders, John Myers, Ali Golshan and Laszlo Bock came up with Gretel.;We;re building right now software that enables developers to automatically check out an anonymized version of the data set,; said Watson. This so-called ;synthetic data; is essentially artificial data that looks and works just like regular sensitive user data. Gretel uses machine learning to categorize the data — like names, addresses and other customer identifiers — and classify as many labels to the data as possible. Once that data is labeled, it can be applied access policies. Then, the platform applies differential privacy — a technique used to anonymize vast amounts of data — so that it;s no longer tied to customer information. ;It;s an entirely fake data set that was generated by machine learning,; said Watson.It;s a pitch that;s already gathering attention. The startup has raised $3.5 million in seed funding to get the platform off the ground from Moonshots Capital, Greylock Partners, Village Global and several angel investors.;At Google, we had to build our own tools to enable our developers to safely access data, because the tools that we needed didn;t exist,; said Sridhar Ramaswamy, a former Google executive, and now a partner at Greylock.Gretel said it will charge customers based on consumption — a similar structure to how Amazon prices access to its cloud computing services.;Right now, it;s very heads-down and building,; said Watson. The startup plans to ramp up its engagement with the developer community in the coming weeks, with an eye on making Gretel available in the next six months, he said.Correction: Due to a miscommunication, an earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Greylock led the seed round.

The round was led by investors 83North and Felix Capital and will be used on hiring, product development and global expansion, particularly in the United States. The startup, which did not disclose its current valuation, said its goal is to reach an annual run rate of $200 million by May.Founded in the United Kingdom, where its service first launched in Nottingham, HungryPanda  is now available in 31 cities in the U.K., Italy, France, Australia, New Zealand and the U.S.Food delivery is a competitive space with tight margins, but HungryPanda is carving out its own niche, and differentiating from competitors like UberEats, Deliveroo and FoodPanda, by tailoring its platform for Chinese-language users, including business owners, and focusing on Chinese food and grocery deliveries. It also accepts payment services like Alipay and WeChat Pay, and uses WeChat for marketing.Chinese communities around the world present a major market opportunity and HungryPanda says its operations in the United Kingdom and New York City are already profitable. According to a U.S. Census Bureau report published last year, the Chinese diaspora around the world ranges from about 10 million, when counting people born in China, to about 45 million under a wider definition that also includes second-generation immigrants and other groups.In a press statement, HungryPanda CEO Eric Liu said “we are delighted to secure the backing of 83North and Felix Capital to bring our unique service to more people in more places. Their unrivaled industry investment experience, coupled with our ability to focus on the precise needs of our customers and launch in every new city within a two-week window, means we are in an ideal position to significantly scale to the business to meet the huge level of demand created by Chinese cuisine.”Both 83North and Felix Capital already have other food delivery startups in their portfolios. 83North is an investor and Just Eat and Helsinki-based Wolt, while Felix Capital has backed Deliveroo and Frichti, a French startup that makes all its meals in-house.",https://tcrn.ch/2v2y73N
1948642,2020-02-20T04:33:02,Liquid Death raises $9M to make canned water cool,"It sounds like Liquid Death has won over investors with its promise to ;murder your thirst.; The startup is announcing that it;s raised $9 million in Series A funding.Liquid Death sells water in a tallboy aluminum can, and it;s expanding the lineup with a sparkling water can that it plans to start shipping in March. A 12-pack of either regular or sparkling mountain water currently costs $18.99 on the Liquid Death website.Co-founder and CEO Mike Cessario has worked as a creative director and copywriter at companies like VaynerMedia, and he told me that his goal is to create a brand that;s healthy and sustainable while being ;just as exciting, if not more exciting, than energy drinks, soda, alcohol and candy.;Hence the ;murder your thirst; tagline, as well as a generally tongue-in-cheek approach to marketing, including aggressive, heavy metal-influenced art. The startup is expanding those efforts with a new ;Keep the Underworld Beautiful; campaign that asks customers to save Hell itself from plastic bottles.;When you’re launching a new brand, if you don’t have millions and millions of dollars to push it out there with [advertising], your only chance of survival is the product itself has to be insanely shareable,; Cessario said. ;You;re going to have a hard enough time funding production. You;re not going to have the money to compete with the Cokes and the Pepsis, so the only way get it out there is if people organically want to share it because of the funny, irreverent marketing.;As one piece of evidence that the message is resonating, the company says there are at least 20 ;random customers; who have received Liquid Death tattoos.The emphasis on branding left me wondering whether the water itself was a bit of a sidenote. Cessario responded that when it comes to food and beverage products, branding is the biggest differentiator, because ;consumers aren;t stupid.; They don;t actually believe that one product is dramatically better than the other; it;s more about which brand they feel affinity with.At the same time, he said that when it comes to turning Liquid Death into more than a one-time novelty purchase, ;The most important thing, first and foremost, is that when someone buys it, they enjoy drinking this water from a can. When they actually have a freezing cold can of Liquid Death, people will continue to come back because they like the product experience.;I;ll note that I;ve tried out Liquid Death myself and can confirm that it;s perfectly fine water. Most notably, there;s something genuinely fun and satisfying about cracking open a new can (though if you do it at work, you;ll probably get some suspicious or amused stares from your coworkers).Cessario also argued that the brand is about ;so much more than loud marketing, it’s about sustainability.; The company makes a big point out of the fact that its aluminum cans are made out of more than 70% recycled material, and that aluminum is ;infinitely recyclable,; making the packaging much more environmentally friendly than plastic bottles. Liquid Death also donates 5 cents for every can sold to nonprofits like 5 Gyres (which fights plastic pollution) and Thirst Project (which works on providing access to clean drinking water around the world).The sustainability message has prompted criticism around the fact that packaged water — even if it;s in an aluminum can — is less sustainable than simply filling up a reusable container with tap water.;We;re definitely not against reusable bottles,; Cessario said when I brought this up. ;But the reality is: Do you think it;s possible to actually get 300 million people, people in the Midwest, to do that 100 percent of the time? It;s highly unrealistic.;Instead, he suggested that he;s happy for people to drink tap water from reusable bottles when it makes sense, and they can turn to Liquid Death at other times — ;at a concert venue, when you;re having a house party, when you’re at a bar.;Liquid Death;s Series A was led by Velvet Sea Ventures, a new firm created by Buddy Media co-founder Michael Lazerow. Ring founder Jamie Siminoff, TOMS founding members Jake Strom and Blake Mycoskie, GirlBoss founder/CEO Sophia Amoruso and Thrive Market CEO Nick Green also participated, as did existing investors Science Inc. and Away co-founder Jen Rubio. Liquid Death has now raised a total of $11.25 million.Cessario said that until now, the majority of the startup;s sales have either come from its website or from Amazon, but one of the main aims with the funding is to get the cans into brick-and-mortar stores. In fact, it;s already taking a big step in that direction, with nationwide availability in Whole Foods stores planned for next month.A brand called Liquid Death wants to sell mountain water to the cool kids",https://tcrn.ch/2T4bJz2
1948593,2020-02-19T22:00:34,The Org nabs $8.5M led by Founders Fund to build a global database of company org charts,"LinkedIn  has cornered the market when it comes to putting your own professional profile online and using it to network for jobs, industry connections and professional development.But when it comes to looking at a chart of the people, and specifically the leadership teams, who make up organizations more holistically, the Microsoft-owned network comes up a little short: you can search by company names, but chances are that you get a list of people based on their connectivity to you, and otherwise in no particular order (including people who may no longer even be at the company). And pointedly, there is little in the way of verification to prove that someone who claims to be working for a company really is.Now, a startup called The Org is hoping to take on LinkedIn and address that gap with an ambitious idea: to build a database (currently free to use) of organizational charts for every leading company, and potentially any company in the world, and then add features after that, such as job advertising ; for example organizations looking to hire people where there are obvious gaps in their org charts.With 16,000 companies profiled so far on its platform, a total of 50,000 companies in its database and around 100,000 visitors per month, The Org is&nbsp;announcing $11 million in funding: a Series A of $8.5 million, and a previously unannounced seed round of $2.5 million.Led by Founders Fund, the Series A also includes participation from Sequoia and Balderton, along with a number of angels.Sequoia is actually a repeat investor: it also led The Org;s $2.5 million seed round, which also had&nbsp;Founders Fund, Kevin Hartz, Elad Gil, Ryan Petersen, and SV Angel in it.&nbsp;Keith Rabois, who is now a partner at Founders Fund but once held the role of VP of business and corporate development at LinkedIn, is also joining the startup;s board of directors.Co-headquartered in New York and Copenhagen, Denmark, The Org was co-founded by Christian Wylonis (CEO) and Andreas Jarbøl, partly inspired by a piece in online tech publication The Information, which provided an org chart for the top people at Airbnb (currently numbering 90 entries).;This article went crazy viral,; Wylonis said in an interview. ;I would understand why someone would be interested in this outside of Airbnb, but it turned out that people inside the company were fascinated by it, too. I started to think,&nbsp;when you take something like an org chart and make it publicly facing, I think it just becomes interesting.;So The Org set out to build a bigger business based on the concept.For now, The Org is aimed at two distinct markets: those outside the company who might most typically be interested in who is working where and doing what and reporting to whom ; for example, recruiters, those in human resources departments who are using the data to model their own organizational charts, or salespeople; and those inside the company (or again, outside) who are simply interested in seeing who does what.The Org is aiming to have 100,000 org charts on its platform by the end of the year, with the longer-term goal being to cover 1 million. For now, the focus is on adding companies in the US before expanding to other markets.But while the idea of building org charts for many companies sounds easy enough, there is also a reason why it hasn;t been done yet: it;s not nearly as simple as it looks. That is one reason why even trying to surmount this issue is of interest to top VCs ; particularly those who have worked in startups and fast-growing tech companies themselves.“Today, information about teams is unstructured, scattered, and unverified, making it hard for employees and recruiters to understand organizational structures,” said Roelof Botha, partner at Sequoia Capital, in a statement.“Organizational charts were the secret weapon to forging partnerships during my 20 years as an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley and Europe. Yet, they are a carefully guarded secret, which have to be painstakingly put together by hand,; said Lars Fjeldsoe-Nielsen, general partner at Balderton Capital, in a statement. ;The Org is surfacing this critical information, improving efficiency from the sales floor to the boardroom.;“Up-to-date org charts can be useful for everything from recruiting to sales, but they are difficult and time consuming to piece together,; added Rabois in a statement. ;The Org is making this valuable information easily accessible in a way we were never able to do at LinkedIn.;The approach that The Org is taking to building these profiles so far has been a collaborative one. While The Org itself might establish some company names and seed and update them with information from publicly available sources, that approach leaves a lot of gaps.This is where a crowdsourced, wiki-style approach comes in. As with other company-based networking services such as Slack, users from a particular company can use their work email addresses to sign into that organization;s profile, and from there they can add or modify entries as you might enter data in a wiki ; the idea being that multiple people getting involved in the edits will help keep the company;s org chart more accurate.While The Org;s idea holds a lot of promise and seems to fill a hole that other platforms like LinkedIn ; or, from another direction, Glassdoor ; do not address in their own profiling of companies, I can see some challenges, too, that it might encounter as it grows.Platforms that provide insights into a company landscape, such as LinkedIn or Glassdoor, are ultimately banked more around individuals and their own representations. That means that by their nature these platforms may not ever provide complete pictures of businesses themselves, just slices of it.The Org, on the other hand, starts from the point of view of presenting the company itself, which means that the resulting gaps that arise might be more apparent if they never get filled in, making The Org potentially less useful as a tool. (Consider for example either making sure the data is up to date, or whether you have a complete or or partial picture of an engineering, marketing or operations team based solely on who has made the effort to update or disclose information).Similarly, if these charts really are often closely guarded by companies (something I don;t doubt is true, since they could pose poaching risks, or copycats in the form of companies attempting to build org structures based on what their more successful competitors are doing), I could see how some companies might start to approach The Org with requests to remove their profiles and corresponding charts.Wylonis said that ;99%; of companies so far have been okay with what The Org is building.;The way that we see it is that transparency is of interest to the people who work there,; he said. ;I think that everyone should strive for that. Why block it? The world is changing, and if the only way to keep your talent is by hiding your org chart you have other problems at your company.;He added that so far The Org has not had any official requests, ;but we have had informal enquiries about how we get our information. And some companies email us about changes. And when an individual person gets in touch and says, ;I don;t want to be here,; we delete that. But it;s only happened a handful of times.; It;s not clear whether that proportion stays the same, or goes up or down, as The Org grows.In the meantime, the other big question that The Org will grapple with is just how granular should it go?;I hope that one day we can have an updated and complete org chart for every business, but that might prove difficult,; Wylonis said. Indeed, that could mean mapping out 1 million people at Walmart, for example. ;For the biggest companies, it may be that it works to map out the top 500, with the top 30-40 for smaller companies. And people can always go in and make corrections to expand those if they want.;Interestingly, the org chart appears to be having something of a startup moment. Just hours after I published this, another called ChartHop announced funding. ChartHop is the other side of the coin from The Org: it;s addressing the same challenge of needing a better way to track and view org charts, but it taps lots of internal resources at the company in question, and is not built with the intention of sharing externally.",https://tcrn.ch/2SFTscu

The Jerusalem native was one of Y Combinator;s early successes, joining with an AI startup that, at 23, he sold to Apple (we reported the deal was between $40-60 million). Gross served as a director of machine learning at Apple before returning to YC ; this time as a partner.At age 28, his role at YC behind him, Gross is now working to revamp the startup accelerator model for a remote future with his startup Pioneer. He;s received backing from Marc Andreessen  and Stripe to build a program he hopes can give founders access to funding streams and talent networks that are nearly impossible to find outside Silicon Valley.;In the way software is eating the world, remote is almost eating earth in the sense that it may very well be the way large companies are created, but also perhaps the way that venture funding takes place,; Gross told TechCrunch in an interview. ;With Pioneer, the product experiment we;re running is an attempt to build a San Francisco or Mountain View ; to build a city on the internet.;Marc Andreessen, one of Pioneer;s early investors.That lofty goal has required quite a bit of tinkering on Gross;s part over the past 18 months since he launched the startup. During that time, he;s shifted the program;s structure from a Reddit-like online contest to win cash grants to what he calls a ;fully remote startup generator; that can help remote founders create companies that later apply to Y Combinator or raise money from Pioneer.;People were really taking advantage of Pioneer as kind of an online accelerator almost organically,; Gross says. ;We decided to kind of operationalize that inside and focus more on funding people that are working on things that will turn into companies and potentially offer them more funding.;Pioneer has already backed more than 100 founders, who have created solutions like remote team product There, desktop app generator ToDesktop and software search engine Metacode.Pioneer is hoping their efforts can provide opportunities to founders in underserved geographies and regions, but like other investors in Silicon Valley, the startup hasn;t been backing nearly as many female founders as their male counterparts. From funded entrepreneurs publicly announced on Pioneer;s blog, less than 15 percent are women.;Pioneer is an engine for finding, funding and mentoring underrated people, many of whom I suspect are female. Our minds are constantly spinning on ways to raise awareness amongst female founders, and we;re working with our community to improve female representation,; Gross wrote in an email response. ;The world could stand to have many more founders like Mathilde Collin (of Front) and Laura Behrens Wu (of Shippo), and we are eager to find them.”One of Pioneer;s livestream discussions during its remote program.Pioneer;s existence is partially the result of an advent of remote work and communication tools, but another real enabler is the competitive market for early-stage investing. Mega VC funds are competing over pre-seed deals for the buzziest startups and Y Combinator;s batch sizes are ballooning, leaving little room for accelerators with similar pitches. As the world of early-stage startup investing gets more crowded, investors are having to get creative. For Gross and his investors, Pioneer also represents an opportunity to scout deal flow earlier in the pipeline.Gross has a weighty portfolio of his own angel investments including GitHub, Figma, Uber, Gusto, Notion, Opendoor, Cruise Automation and Coinbase.An earlier structure gave Pioneer the right to invest up to $100K in startups emerging from the program if they went onto raise, but just 30% of grant awardees went on to found companies, Gross tells me. In its 2.0 form, Pioneer wants participants to give up 1% of their company to join the one-month remote program. The accelerator won;t give them cash but will help founders incorporate their startups, give them guidance via a network of experts, and toss some other substantial perks like $100K worth of cloud credits and a roundtrip ticket to San Francisco to inject a bit of face-to-face time into the process.Greatly enjoyed the first Pioneer (@pioneerdotapp) Summit! pic.twitter.com/fIvdA24Kdf&mdash; Patrick Collison (@patrickc) October 26, 2019The biggest evolution is the more formalized investment structure for founders exiting the program. If Pioneer is excited about the progress of a particular startup, they may give it the option to raise directly from Pioneer upon completion, sticking it in one of three investment buckets and investing between $20K and $1 million.Gross acknowledges that Pioneer will largely be making bets closer to the $20K mark as the accelerator scales its portfolio. Pioneer is relying on an undisclosed amount of early funding from Gross, Andreessen and Stripe for both its investments and operating expenses. Gross says that the company has additional funding sources lined up to facilitate some of these larger investments, but that he;s reticent to raise too much too early. ;This being my second rodeo, I;m well aware of the downsides of over-capitalizing and so I think we;re going to remain nimble and frugal,; Gross says.Gross isn;t looking to replace Y Combinator, and realizes that for founders with plenty of options, Pioneer;s investments might not be the most enticing. Y Combinator invest $150K in startups for a 7% slice of equity, by comparison, a $20K investment from Pioneer will cost founders 5% of their company plus the 1% they gave up to join the accelerator in the first place. Nevertheless, Gross hopes that plenty of founders sitting on great ideas will want to take advantage of this deal.;I think there are a lot of great companies that instead of being listed on the S&amp;P 500 are stuck at the phase where they;re just a Python script.;Daniel Gross of Apple leaves to become Y Combinator;s newest partner",https://tcrn.ch/2T0SYwq

Anne Wojcicki,  the founder of 23andMe,  is also an investor in the company.“Maven  is addressing critical gaps in care by offering the largest digital health network of women’s and family health providers,” said Tom Mawhinney, lead investor from Icon Ventures, who will join the Maven board of directors, in a statement. “With its virtual care and services, Maven is changing how global employers support working families by focusing on improving maternal outcomes, reducing medical costs, retaining more women in the workplace, and ultimately supporting every pathway to parenthood.”In the six years since founder Katherine Ryder first launched Maven, the company has raised more than $77 million for its service and she became a mother of two boys.“You go through this enormous life experience; it’s hugely transformative to have a child,” she told TechCrunch after announcing the company;s $27 million Series B round, led by Sequoia. “You do it when your career is moving up — they call it the rush hour of life — and with no one supporting you on the other end, it’s easy to say ‘screw it, I’m going home to my family’ … If someone leaves the workforce, that’s fine, it’s their choice, but they shouldn’t feel forced to because they don’t have support.”Some of Maven;s partners include Snap and Bumble to provide employees access to its women;s and family health provider network.

1946724,2020-02-19T08:42:55,Autonomous yard trucking startup Outrider comes out of stealth with $53 million in funding,"The 400,000 distribution yards located in the U.S. are critical hubs for the supply chain. Now one startup is aiming to make the yard truck — the centerpiece of the distribution yard — more efficient, safer and cleaner, with an autonomous system.Outrider, a Golden, Colo. startup previously known as Azevtec, came out of stealth Wednesday to announce that it has raised $53 million in seed and Series A funding rounds led by NEA  and 8VC. Outrider is also backed by Koch Disruptive Technologies,  Fraser McCombs Capital, warehousing giant Prologis, Schematic Ventures, Loup Ventures and Goose Society of Texas.Outrider CEO Andrew Smith said distribution yards are ideal environments to deploy autonomous technology because they;re well-defined areas that are also complex, often chaotic and with many manual tasks.;This is why a systems approach is necessary to automate every major task in the yard,; Smith said.Outrider has developed a system that includes an electric yard truck equipped with a full stack self-driving system with overlapping suite of sensor technology such as radar, lidar and cameras. The system automates the manual aspect of yard operations, including moving trailers around the yard as well as to and from loading docks. The system can also hitch and unhitch trailers, connect and disconnect trailer brake lines, and monitor trailer locations.The company has two pilot programs with Georgia-Pacific and four Fortune 200 companies in designated sections of their distribution yards. Over time, Outrider will move from operating in specific areas of these yards to taking over the entire yards for these enterprise customers, according to Smith.;Because we;re getting people out of these yard environments, where there;s 80,000 pound vehicles, we;re delivering increased efficiency,; Smith told TechCrunch in a recent interview. That efficiency is not just in moving the trailers around the yard, Smith added. It also helps move the Class 8 semi trailers used for hauling freight long distances through the system and back on the road quickly.;We can actually reduce the amount of time the over-the-road guys are stuck sitting at a yard trying to do a pickup or drop-off,; Smith said.Smith sees a big opportunity to demonstrate the responsible deployment of autonomy as well as clean up yards filled with diesel-powered yard trucks.;If there was ever a location for near-term automation and electrification of the supply chain, it;s here,; he said. ;Our customers and suppliers understand there;s a big opportunity for these autonomy systems to accelerate the deployment of 50,000 plus electric trucks in the market because they are a superior platform for automation.;",https://tcrn.ch/2HBTbAX
1948277,2020-02-19T08:30:00,SentinelOne raises $200M at a $1.1B valuation to expand its AI-based endpoint security platform,"As cybercrime continues to evolve and expand, a startup that is building a business focused on endpoint security has raised a big round of funding. SentinelOne ; which provides a machine learning-based solution for monitoring and securing laptops, phones, containerised applications and the many other devices and services connected to a network ; has picked up $200 million, a Series E round of funding that it says catapults its valuation to $1.1 billion.The funding is notable not just for its size but for its velocity: it comes just eight months after SentinelOne  announced a Series D of $120 million, which at the time valued the company around $500 million. In other words, the company has more than doubled its valuation in less than a year ; a sign of the cybersecurity times.This latest round is being led by Insight Partners,  with Tiger Global Management,  Qualcomm Ventures LLC, Vista Public Strategies of Vista Equity Partners, Third Point Ventures and other undisclosed previous investors all participating.Tomer Weingarten, CEO and co-founder of the company, said in an interview that while this round gives SentinelOne the flexibility to remain in ;startup; mode (privately funded) for some time ; especially since it came so quickly on the heels of the previous large round ; an IPO ;would be the next logical step; for the company. ;But we;re not in any rush,; he added. ;We have one to two years of growth left as a private company.;While cybercrime is proving to be a very expensive business (or very lucrative, I guess, depending on which side of the equation you sit on), it has also meant that the market for cybersecurity has significantly expanded.Endpoint security, the area where SentinelOne concentrates its efforts, last year was estimated to be around an $8 billion market, and analysts project that it could be worth as much as $18.4 billion by 2024.Driving it is the single biggest trend that has changed the world of work in the last decade. Everyone ; whether a road warrior or a desk-based administrator or strategist, a contractor or full-time employee, a front-line sales assistant or back-end engineer or executive ; is now connected to the company network, often with more than one device. And that;s before you consider the various other ;endpoints; that might be connected to a network, including machines, containers and more. The result is a spaghetti of a problem. One survey from LogMeIn, disconcertingly, even found that some 30% of IT managers couldn;t identify just how many endpoints they managed.;The proliferation of devices and the expanding network are the biggest issues today,; said Weingarten. ;The landscape is expanding and it is getting very hard to monitor not just what your network looks like but what your attackers are looking for.;This is where an AI-based solution like SentinelOne;s comes into play. The company has roots in the Israeli cyberintelligence community but is based out of Mountain View, and its platform is built around the idea of working automatically not just to detect endpoints and their vulnerabilities, but to apply behavioral models, and various modes of protection, detection and response in one go ; in a product that it calls its Singularity  Platform that works across the entire edge of the network.;We are seeing more automated and real-time attacks that themselves are using more machine learning,; Weingarten said. ;That translates to the fact that you need defence that moves in real time as with as much automation as possible.;SentinelOne is by no means the only company working in the space of endpoint protection. Others in the space include Microsoft,  CrowdStrike, Kaspersky, McAfee, Symantec  and many others.But nonetheless, its product has seen strong uptake to date. It currently has some 3,500 customers, including three of the biggest companies in the world, and ;hundreds; from the global 2,000 enterprises, with what it says has been 113% year-on-year new bookings growth, revenue growth of 104% year-on-year and 150% growth year-on-year in transactions over $2 million. It has 500 employees today and plans to hire up to 700 by the end of this year.One of the key differentiators is the focus on using AI, and using it at scale to help mitigate an increasingly complex threat landscape, to take endpoint security to the next level.“Competition in the endpoint market has cleared with a select few exhibiting the necessary vision and technology to flourish in an increasingly volatile threat landscape,” said Teddie Wardi, managing director of Insight Partners, in a statement. “As evidenced by our ongoing financial commitment to SentinelOne along with the resources of Insight Onsite, our business strategy and ScaleUp division, we are confident that SentinelOne has an enormous opportunity to be a market leader in the cybersecurity space.”Weingarten said that SentinelOne ;gets approached every year; to be acquired, although he didn;t name any names. Nevertheless, that also points to the bigger consolidation trend that will be interesting to watch as the company grows. SentinelOne has never made an acquisition to date, but it;s hard to ignore that, as the company to expand its products and features, that it might tap into the wider market to bring in other kinds of technology into its stack.;There are definitely a lot of security companies out there,; Weingarten noted. ;Those that serve a very specific market are the targets for consolidation.;",https://tcrn.ch/2uPySgP
1948255,2020-02-19T08:05:54,"Talking cybersecurity, SaaS and early-stage valuations with ForgePoint Capital","Earlier today TechCrunch covered the launch of a new, $450 million cybersecurity-focused fund, the second from venture group ForgePoint Capital.The new vehicle, inventively named Fund II, will mostly focus on early-stage companies in the cybersecurity space. The fund;s timing is somewhat unsurprising. As we noted in our earlier coverage, the recent IPOs of Cloudflare (more here) and CrowdStrike (more here) have given cybsersecurity a halo, showing founders and investors alike that outsize returns are possible in the space. Such successes can;t hurt VCs looking for fresh capital.To get a stronger grip on how ForgePoint sees the market, TechCrunch corresponded with the group, asking about fund mechanics (check sizes, investing pace), the cybersecurity sector itself (business models, valuations) and recent liquidity events (CrowdStrike in particular). ForgePoint;s Alberto Yépez, a co-founder and managing director at the group, answered our questions.The following interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length. Let;s have some fun:TechCrunch: The new fund is $150 million larger than its predecessor. Why raise 50% more for the new vehicle? What is the target number of checks per year? Will it be faster than the preceding fund?ForgePoint Capital:  We were one of the first investors to focus on cybersecurity when we raised our first fund. Since then, the cybersecurity market has grown by more than 50%, driven by the constantly evolving challenges facing businesses, governments and individuals. We’ve also doubled our investment team. Our team has a singular focus on the market, driving unparalleled domain expertise and insights into emerging industry trends.We will continue to invest in six to ten new cybersecurity companies per year, and find great opportunities with leading entrepreneurs.Putting capital to work in ;early-stage and select growth companies” is delightfully flexible. What check size range is the fund targeting, and what is the target deal size for growth-oriented deals?We target up to $25 million for early-stage ventures throughout the life of an investment, and up to $50 million for growth-oriented companies achieving considerable revenue growth.How much did Crowdstrike’s successful IPO boost cybersecurity-focused startup valuations and fundraising last year?A rising tide lifts all boats. In cybersecurity, as elsewhere, the market rewards rapid growth and valuations reflect [that]. We target companies with great teams building innovative solutions that are poised for high growth. While the Crowdstrike IPO certainly boosted attention on the market, over 90% of successful cybersecurity exits are through M&amp;A. Strategic buyers and financial sponsors pay up for companies that can scale.",https://tcrn.ch/37Fmnlf
1948338,2020-02-19T07:57:09,India;s Swiggy raises $113M led by Prosus,"Weeks after Zomato acquired Uber’s food delivery business in India, its chief local rival is bulking up some ammunition of its own.Swiggy,  India’s largest food delivery startup, announced on Wednesday it has raised $113 million as part of its Series I financing round. Prosus Ventures, the biggest venture capital for food delivery startups, led the round.Meituan Dianping and Wellington Management Company also participated. The new round values Swiggy at about $3.6 billion, only slightly above its $3.3 billion valuation from the previous round, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The startup has raised about $1.57 billion to date.Sriharsha Majety, co-founder and chief executive of Swiggy, said the startup will use the fresh capital to invest in “new lines of business” such as cloud kitchens and delivery beyond food items, and get on a “sustainable path to profitability.”Prosus Ventures,  formerly known as Naspers Ventures and Food, first wrote a check to Swiggy three years ago. Since then, it has become its biggest investor ; having pumped in more than $700 million alone in the startup’s $1 billion financing round in December 2018.“Swiggy continues to exhibit strong execution and a steadfast commitment to delivering the best service to consumers and has one of the best operational teams in food delivery globally. We are confident Swiggy will continue on a path to earn a significant place in the daily lives of Indians,” said Larry Illg, chief executive of Prosus Ventures and Food, in a statement.The Bangalore-headquartered firm, which is operational in 520 cities, said it has witnessed a 2.5x growth in the volume of transactions in the past year. Its restaurant partners base has also grown to 160,000 and more than 10,000 are joining the platform each month.Some analysts say that it will be very challenging for Swiggy and Zomato,  both of which are spending over $20 million a month to win customers, to reach profitability.Unlike in the developed markets like the U.S., where the order value of each delivery is about $33, in India, a similar item carries the price tag of $4.Anand Lunia, a VC at India Quotient, said in a recent podcast that the food delivery firms have little choice but to keep subsidizing the cost of food items on their platform as otherwise most of their customers can;t afford to get their lunch and dinner from them.The exit of Uber  from India;s food delivery space has, however, made the market a duopoly play, so investors remain bullish. At stake is a $4.2 billion opportunity, according to research firm Redseer.

1948259,2020-02-19T07:24:03,"Level launches a mobile banking app offering 1% cash back on debit purchases, 2.10% APY","A number of startups are taking on big banks with new apps that offer modern, mobile banking experiences, innovative features and reduced or even zero fees. Entering this now-crowded market is Level, a challenger bank and banking app with advantages like 1% cash back on debit card purchases, 2.1% APY on deposits, early access to paychecks and no fees.The banking service is the latest from the same team behind the ;debit-style; credit card called Zero, aimed at millennials who want the benefits of credit without the potential for overspending. As Zero, the company last year closed on $20 million in Series A funding from New Enterprise Associates (NEA), SignalFire, Eniac Ventures and Nyca, bringing its total raise to date $35 million. It now has tens of thousands of users.Similar to Zero, Level also targets a younger demographic ; in this case, those who no longer see the need for physical banks, when a bank account, useful app and debit card is all they need. Today, there are several of these sorts of banking services to choose from; in the U.S., for example, there;s Simple, Ally, Chime, Varo, N26, Current, Space, Step, Stash, Empower and others.Level takes on these rival challenger banks, too, by offering a higher 2.10% APY on its FDIC-insured deposits, without requiring a minimum balance. The company notes that;s 35x the national average, based on U.S. bank balances with a less than $100,000 balance.It also snags a feature popular with credit card users, by offering 1.0% unlimited cash bank on debit card spending. This cashback applies to both signature-based and online purchases, and is paid out on accounts that have at least a $1,000 monthly direct deposit. To be clear, a signature-based purchase means you select ;credit; instead of ;debit; when paying at point-of-sale. This determines how the merchant processes the transaction and the fees it pays. In Level;s case, it;s sharing some of those fees back with customers as the ;cash back; option.Level could benefit from consumers believing that running a card as credit takes an extra step. In some cases, customers may skip this when they;re in a hurry and run the card as a debit instead ; allowing Level to keep the fees for itself.Like many challenger banks, Level offers early access to your paycheck. For customers with a direct deposit, Level will make the funds available based on when they are received, which could be up to two days early.Also like most other banking startups, Level ditches the numerous fees big banks charge. There are no monthly, overdraft, foreign transaction or add-on ATM fees, says Level, and no minimum balance is required to have an account. It will even reimburse ATM fees worldwide up to three times per month, at up to $4 per reimbursement to take the sting out of the increasingly costly fees to access your cash.Level additionally includes features that have now become part of the baseline experience for challenger banking apps, like being able to see transactions on a map, lock a missing debit card from the app and receive push notifications for purchases, refunds and transfers.The app itself has a clean, modern almost minimalist design, making it simple to understand and navigate. However, it sadly opted for that terrible design trend of using an overly lightened gray font on a white background. This could put off older customers, as it makes the screen harder to read.However, where it;s lacking is in the more robust bill, expense and goal planning features offered by other banking apps like Simple, Empower or N26, for example, which help users better plan for both recurring expenses as well as long-term goals.However, like most (but not all) of the digital banks operating today in the U.S., Level itself is not a bank. Its customers; funds are actually held in FDIC-insured accounts (up to $250,000) through Evolve Bank &amp; Trust. Level, meanwhile, provides the technology, the customer-facing experience and banking services.;Level was built to challenge the status quo in banking and put an end to the era of big banks holding people’s money while giving them no interest, a clunky app experience, and frustrating customer service,; said Level founder and CEO Bryce Galen, in a statement.;Although several challenger banks have launched in recent years and most compare favorably to traditional banks, surprisingly few of them deliver a strong enough customer value prop to truly compel people to switch their primary banking,; Galen told TechCrunch. ;For instance, Square Cash has a reliable app with rotating cash back perks, but lacks FDIC insurance or phone customer support. Chime has FDIC insurance and phone customer support, but lacks meaningful customer rewards or 24/7 support availability,; he continued.;Level addresses this by leveraging the technical foundation, team experience, and bank partner deals that undergird Zero to deliver better customer value across all these dimensions — app, support, and economics — in a highly accessible product,; Galen said.Level is available today on both iOS and Android, after first signing up on levelbank.com or on mobile.Updated 2/19/20, 3:15 PM ET with further comments from Level. ",https://tcrn.ch/2HF0Le1
1948095,2020-02-19T06:00:19,BluBracket scores $6.5M seed to help secure code in distributed environments,"BluBracket, a new security startup from the folks who brought you Vera, came out of stealth today and announced a $6.5 million seed investment. Unusual Ventures led the round with participation by Point72 Ventures, SignalFire and Firebolt Ventures.The company was launched by Ajay Arora  and Prakash Linga, who until last year were CEO and CTO respectively at Vera, a security company that helps companies secure documents by having the security profile follow the document wherever it goes.Arora says he and Linga are entrepreneurs at heart, and they were itching to start something new after more than five years at Vera. While Arora still sits on the Vera board, they decided to attack a new problem.He says that the idea for BluBracket  actually came out of conversations with Vera customers, who wanted something similar to Vera, except to protect code. ;About 18-24 months ago, we started hearing from our customers, who were saying, ;Hey you guys secure documents and files. What;s becoming really important for us is to be able to share code. Do you guys secure source code?';That was not a problem Vera was suited to solve, but it was a light bulb moment for Arora and Linga, who saw an opportunity and decided to seize it. Recognizing the way development teams operated has changed, they started BluBracket and developed a pair of products to handle the unique set of problems associated with a distributed set of developers working out of a Git repository ; whether that;s GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket.The first product is BluBracket CodeInsight, which is an auditing tool, available starting today. This tool gives companies full visibility into who has withdrawn the code from the Git repository. ;Once they have a repo, and then developers clone it, we can help them understand what clones exist on what devices, what third parties have their code, and even be able to search open source projects for code that might have been pushed into open source. So we;re creating what we call a blueprint of where the enterprise code is,; Arora explained.The second tool, BluBracket CodeSecure, which won;t be available until later in the year, is how you secure that code including the ability to classify code by level importance. Code tagged with the highest level of importance will have special status and companies can attach rules to it like that it can;t be distributed to an open source folder without explicit permission.They believe the combination of these tools will enable companies to maintain control over the code, even in a distributed system. Arora says they have taken care to make sure that the system provides the needed security layer without affecting the operation of the continuous delivery pipeline.;When you;re compiling or when you;re going from development to staging to production, in those cases because the code is sitting in Git, and the code itself has not been modified, BluBracket won;t break the chain,; he explained. If you tried to distribute special code outside the system, you might get a message that this requires authorization, depending on how the tags have been configured.This is very early days for BluBracket, but the company takes its first steps as a startup this week and emerges from stealth next week at the RSA security conference in San Francisco. It will be participating in the RSA Sandbox competition for early security startups at the conference, as well.Three-year old startup Vera scores huge deal to protect all of GE;s IP",https://tcrn.ch/2Hz0md8

It starts with the order and goes all the way to revenue as a one-time payment or recurring subscription. Today the company announced a $10 million Series A.CRV led the round with participation from Clocktower Ventures and existing investors Lerer Hippeau and Revolution Rise of the Rest fund. The company has now raised a total of $12.5 million, according to Crunchbase data.Sameer Gulati, founder and CEO at Ordway,  says the company wanted to build a flexible tool to sit between the CRM and financial systems of a company. ;So in that sense, we do everything for post-sales from billing automation, payment collection, revenue recognition, analytics, all the way to cash. We have a streamlined workflow for managing order to revenue,; Gulati told TechCrunch.It sounds a lot like the Quote-to-Cash space where companies like Apttus (acquired by Thoma Bravo in 2018) or SteelBrick (acquired by Salesforce in 2015) tried to stake a claim, but Gulati says while his company;s solution handles the quote-to-cash workflow, it can do much more than that.;We absolutely can handle the workflow from quote to billing to payments to revenue, for sure. But the reason Ordway has a niche is because we are a lot more configurable and a lot more flexible to accommodate any workflow out there,; he said.He says his company;s solution connects to the CRM system on one side and the financial systems on the other. They are compatible with all the major CRM tools including Salesforce and Dynamics 365. And they support a range of financial tools like NetSuite or QuickBooks.;In fact, we can work with any back-end small system to a large scale ERP system, but our value add is automating the movement of data into the ERP. So we are the operational framework between sales and traditional ERP. We will handle everything in between,; he said.As for the funding, Gulati has the kind of plans you would expect with a Series A investment. ;The core goal is definitely to accelerate all aspects of our business from sales and marketing to product and engineering, and most importantly, customer success. Basically, in a sense we are doubling down on making sure our customers are successful in solving their core sales to finance business challenges,; he said.The company launched in 2018 and has 25 employees today.

1948187,2020-02-19T04:00:42,Online learning marketplace Udemy raises $50M at a $2B valuation from Japanese publisher Benesse,"The internet has, for better or worse, become the default platform for people seeking information, and today one of the companies leveraging that to deliver educational content has raised some funding to fuel its next stage of growth.Udemy, which provides a marketplace offering some 150,000 different online learning courses from business analytics to ukulele lessons, has picked up $50 million from a single investor, Benesse Holdings, the Japan-based educational publisher that has been Udemy;s partner in the country. The investment was made at a $2 billion pre-money valuation, it said.This is a big jump since the startup last raised money, a $60 million round in 2016 that valued it at around $710 million (according to PitchBook data). With this round, Udemy has raised around $200 million in funding, with other investors including Stripes, Naspers (now Prosus), Learn Capital, Insight Partners, Norwest Venture Partners, and a number of others.The plan will be to use the funding to expand the various aspects of Udemy;s  business. On one hand, it provides a vast array of courses for consumers that can be purchased a la carte, which, to date, have been used by some 50 million students. It also has, in more recent years, expanded to enterprise services, where Udemy works with companies like Adidas, General Mills, Toyota, Wipro, Pinterest and Lyft and others ; 5,000 in all ; to develop and administer subscription-based professional development courses. Udemy;s president Darren Shimkus describes it as a ;Netflix-style; model, where users are presented with a dashboard listing a range of courses that they can take on demand.Udemy will also be looking at improving how courses are delivered by and from its 57,000-strong network of instructors, as well as consider new areas it might move into more deeply. The bigger picture is that Udemy will be investing to address better what Shimkus said is the biggest challenge not just for the company, but for the global workforce overall:;The biggest challenge is for learners is to figure out what skills are emerging, what they can do to compete best in the global market,; he said. ;We’re in a world that’s changing so quickly that skills that were valued just three or four years ago are no longer relevant. People are confused and don’t know what they should be learning.; That;s a challenge that also stands for businesses, he added, which are trying to work out what he described as their ;three to five year human capital roadmap.;Udemy also plans to expand international operations, starting with Japan but also extending to other markets where Udemy has seen strong growth, such as Brazil and India.“We’ve worked closely with Benesse for several years, and this investment is a testament to the strength of our relationship and the opportunity ahead of us,” said Gregg Coccari, CEO of Udemy, in a statement. “Udemy is on a mission to improve lives through learning, and so is Benesse. 2020 will be a milestone year where we serve millions more students and enable thousands of businesses and governments to upskill their employees. This growth wouldn’t be possible without our expert instructors who partner with us every step of the way as we build this business.”Benesse;s business spans instructional materials for children to courses for adults both online and in in-person training centers. One of the better-known brands that it owns is Berlitz, which operates both virtual courses as well as a network of physical schools for learning languages. Udemy has been developing content alongside Benesse both in Japanese as well as English, Shimkus said, targeting both consumer and business markets.“Access to the latest workplace skills is crucial for success everywhere, including Japan, and Udemy is the world’s largest marketplace enabling professional transformation. With this partnership, we envision a world where more people can continue to learn continuously throughout their lives,” said Tamotsu Adachi, Representative Director, President and CEO of Benesse Holdings Inc., in a statement. “Udemy and Benesse are incredibly synergistic businesses. This investment is the next progression in our business relationship and demonstrates our confidence in what we can accomplish together.”Udemy;s expansion comes at a time when online education overall has generally continued to grow, although not without bumps.Among those that compete at least in part with it, Coursera  last year announced a $103 million round of funding at a $1 billion+ valuation and made its first acquisition to expand how it teaches programming and other computer science subjects. And in Asia, Byju;s in India is now valued at $8 billion after a quick succession of large growth rounds. We;ve also heard that Age of Learning, which quietly raised at a $1 billion valuation in 2016, is also gearing up for another round.On the other hand, not all is rosy. Another big name in online learning, Udacity  (not to be confused with Udemy), laid off 20% of its workforce amid a larger restructuring; and further afield, Kano ; which merges online learning with DIY hardware kits ; has also laid off and restructured in recent months. Meanwhile, we don;t seem to hear much these days from LinkedIn Learning, another would-be competitor that rebranded Lynda.com after it was acquired by the social networking site (itself owned by Microsoft).Unlike Coursera  and others that aim for full degrees that are potentially aiming to disrupt higher education, Udemy focuses on short courses, either simply for the student;s own interest, or potentially for certifications from organizations that either help administer the courses or ;own; the subject in question. (For example, Cisco  for networking certifications, or Microsoft  for its software packages, or the PMI for a course related to project management.)Those courses are delivered by individuals who form the other half of Udemy;s two-sided marketplace. In the 10 years that it;s been in business, Udemy has worked with some 57,000 instructors to develop courses, and in the marketplace model, Shimkus told TechCrunch  that those instructors have netted $350 million in payments to date. (He would not disclose Udemy;s cut on those courses, nor whether the company is currently profitable.)There are a lot of areas that Udemy has yet to tackle that present opportunities for how it might evolve. Working with both enterprises and a large base of consumer usage, there is, for example, a lot of scope to develop more data analytics about what is used, what is popular, and how to tailor courses in a better way to fit those models to improve outcomes and engagement.Another area potentially could see Udemy moving deeper into specific subject areas like language learning, where it offers some courses today but has a lot of scope for growing, particularly leaning on what Benesse has with Berlitz. To date, Udemy has made no acquisitions, but that is also a route that could also become an option, Shimkus said.",https://tcrn.ch/38GbSzv

The company is now a Visa Principal Member, which should help Coinbase rely less on Paysafe and control a bigger chunk of the card payment stack.Coinbase says it is the only cryptocurrency company that has reached that level of certification. The company will offer the Coinbase Card in more markets in the future. The new status could open up more possibilities and features as well.While Coinbase originally launched the Coinbase Card in the U.K., it is now available in 29 European countries. It works with any Visa-compatible payment terminal and ATM. Users can decide in the app which wallet they want to use for upcoming transactions. This way, you can spend money in 10 cryptocurrencies.There are some conversion fees just like on Coinbase. In addition to those fees, there can be some additional fees if you withdraw a lot of money or make a purchase abroad. More details here.Still, half of users who ordered a card are actively using it. The U.K., Italy, Spain and France are the main markets so far. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might not replace Visa and Mastercard just yet, so traditional debit cards represent a good alternative for now.",https://tcrn.ch/2V6xFMv

Well now Twitter has the talent for both, as it has just acquired Chroma Labs. Co-founded by Instagram Boomerang inventor John Barnett, Chroma Labs; Chroma Stories app let you fill in stylish layout templates and frames for posting collages and more to Instagram Stories, Snapchat, and more.Rather than keeping Chroma Stories around, Twitter will be splitting up the Chroma Labs squad to work on its product, design and engineering teams. The Chroma Stories iPhone app won;t be shut down, but it won;t get more updates and will only work until there;s some breaking change to iOS.Thrilled to welcome the amazing @Chroma_Labs team including @picturejohn, @alexli, @joshuacharris to @Twitter. They’ll join our product, design, and eng teams working to give people more creative ways to express themselves on Twitter 🎨💬&mdash; Kayvon Beykpour (@kayvz) February 18, 2020;When we founded Chroma Labs in 2018, we set out to build a company to inspire creativity and help people tell their visual stories. During the past year, we’ve enabled creators and businesses around the world to create millions of stories with the Chroma Stories app,; the Chroma Labs team writes on its site. ;We’re proud of this work, and look forward to continuing our mission at a larger scale – with one of the most important services in the world.;We;ve reached out to Twitter for more details on the deal and any price paid. [Update: Twitter confirms this is an acquisition, not just and acqui-hire of the team as it first appeared, though Chroma Stories is shutting down. It refused to disclose the terms of the acquisition, but said all seven employees of Chroma Labs are coming aboard. The team will be working on the Conversations division at Twitter, and the deal is meant to boost its talent, leadership, and expertise for serving public discussions. A Twitter spokesperson also confirms that Chroma will shut down its business and future versions of the app will not be available.]Founded in late 2018, Chroma Labs had raised a seed round in early 2019 and counted Sweet Capital, Index Ventures, and Combine VC as investors. Barnett;s fellow co-founders include CTO Alex Li, who was an engineering manager on Facebook Photos and Instagram Stories; and Joshua Harris, a former product design manager on the Oculus Rift and Facebook;s augmented reality filters.With Chroma Stories, you could choose between retro filters, holiday-themed frames, and snazzy collage templates to make your Stories look special amidst the millions posted each day. Sensor Tower estimates Chroma Stories had 37,000 US downloads and 617,000 global downloads to date. That tepid reception despite the app;s quality might explain why the team is joining Twitter.By snatching up some of the smartest talent in visual storytelling, Twitter could give its text-focused app some spice. It;s one of the few social apps without a Stories product already, and its creative tools are quite limited. Better ways to lay out photos in tweets could make Twitter more beautiful and less exhausting to sift through. That might make it more appealing to teens and help it boost its user count, which now lags behind Snapchat.Twitter has become the world;s public record for words. The Chroma Labs talent might make it the real-time gallery for art and design as well.[Update 3:05pm Pacific: Twitter confirms that this is a full acquisition of the Chroma Labs company, not just an acquisition as we originally printed.]",https://tcrn.ch/2wrbqXr
1947876,2020-02-18T11:54:55,"TubeMogul, Uber alums launch Arize AI for AI observability","A new startup called Arize AI is building what it calls a real-time analytics platform for ;observability; in artificial intelligence and machine learning.The company is led by CEO Jason Lopatecki, who has also served as chief strategy officer and chief innovation officer at TubeMogul, the video ad company acquired by Adobe. TubeMogul;s co-founder and former CEO Brett Wilson is an investor and board member.While Arize AI  is only coming out of stealth today, it has already raised $4 million in funding led by Foundation Capital,  with participation from Wilson and Trinity Ventures.And it has already made an acquisition: a Y Combinator -backed startup called Monitor ML. The entire Monitor ML team is joining Arize, and its CEO Aparna Dhinakaran (who previously built machine learning infrastructure at Uber) is becoming Arize;s co-founder and chief product officer.Lopatecki and Dhinakaran said that even when they were leading two separate startups, they were trying to solve similar problems — problems that they both saw at big companies.;Businesses are deploying these complex models that are hard to understand, they’re not easy to troubleshoot or debug,; Lopatecki said. So if an AI or ML model isn;t delivering the desired results, ;The state of the art today is: You file a ticket, the data scientist comes back with a complicated answer, everyone’s scratching their head, everyone hopes the problem’s gone away. As you push more and more models into the organization, that;s just not good enough.;Similarly Dhinakaran said that at Uber, she saw her team spend a lot of time ;answering the question, ;Hey, is the model performing well?; And diving into that model performance was really a tough problem.;Machine learning startup Weights &#038; Biases raises $15MTo solve it, she said, ;The first phase is: How can we make it easier to get these real-time analytics and insights about your model straight to the people who are monitoring it in production, the data scientist or the product manager or engineering team?;Lopatecki added that Arize AI is providing more than just ;a metric that says it’s good or bad,; but rather a wide range of information that can help teams see how a model is performing — and if there are issues, whether those issues are with the data or with the model itself.Besides giving companies a better handle on how their AI and ML models are doing, Lopatecki said this will also allow customers to make better use of their data scientists: ;[You don;t want] the smallest, most expensive team troubleshooting and trying to explain whether it was a correct prediction or not ; You want insights surfaced up [to other teams], so your head researcher is doing research, not explaining that research to the rest of the team.;He compared Arize AI;s tools to Google Analytics, but added, ;I don;t want to say it’s an executive dashboard, that’s not the right positioning of the platform. It;s an engineering product, similar to Splunk — it;s really for engineers, not the execs.;Lopatecki also acknowledged that it can be tough to make sense of the AI and ML landscape right now (;I;m technical, I did EECS at Berkeley, I understand ML extremely well, but even I can be confused by some of the companies in this space;). He argued that while most other companies are trying to tackle the entire AI pipeline, ;We;re really focusing on production.;New Uber feature uses machine learning to sort business and personal rides",https://tcrn.ch/2P5X7hq
1947884,2020-02-18T11:27:02,"Noom competitor OurPath rebrands as Second Nature, raises $10M Series A","Back in 2018, OurPath emerged as a startup in the U.K. tackling the problem of diabetes. The company helped customers fight the disease, and raised a $3 million round of funding by combining advice from health experts with tracking technology via a smartphone app to help people build healthy habits and lose weight.Now rebranded as Second Nature, it has raised a fresh $10 million in Series A funding.New investors include Uniqa Ventures, the venture capital fund of Uniqa, a European insurance group, and the founders of mySugr, the digital diabetes management platform, which was acquired by health giant Roche .The round also secured the backing of existing investors including Connect and Speedinvest, two European seed funds, and Bethnal Green Ventures,  the early-stage Impact investor, as well as angels including Taavet Hinrikus,  founder of TransferWise.This new injection takes the total investment in the company to $13 million.Competitors to the company include Weight Watchers and Noom, which provides a similar program and has raised $114.7 million.Second Nature claims to have a different, more intensive and personalized approach to create habit change. The startup claims 10,000 of its participants revealed an average weight loss of 5.9kg at the 12-week mark. Separate peer-reviewed scientific data published by the company showed that much of this weight-loss is sustained at the six-month and 12-month mark.Under its former guise as OurPath,  the startup was the first ;lifestyle change program; to be commissioned by the NHS for diabetes management.Second Nature was founded in 2015 by Chris Edson and Mike Gibbs, former healthcare strategy consultants, who designed the program to provide people with personalized support in order to make lifestyle changes.Participants receive a set of ;smart; scales and an activity tracker that links with the app, allowing them to track their weight loss progress and daily step count. They are placed in a peer support group of 15 people starting simultaneously. Each group is coached by a qualified dietitian or nutritionist, who provides participants with daily 1:1 advice, support and motivation via the app. Throughout the 12-week program, people have access to healthy recipes and daily articles covering topics like meal planning, how to sleep better and overcoming emotional eating.Gibbs said: “Our goal at Second Nature is to solve obesity. We need to rise above the confusing health misinformation to provide clarity about what’s really important: changing habits. Our new brand and investment will help us realize that.”Philip Edmondson-Jones, investment manager at Beringea,  who led the investment and joins the board of directors of Second Nature, said: “Healthcare systems are struggling to cope with spiraling rates of obesity and associated illnesses, which are projected to cost the global economy $1.2 trillion annually by 2025. Second Nature’s pioneering approach to lifestyle change empowers people to address these conditions.”",https://tcrn.ch/3bReVqj
1947565,2020-02-18T10:31:42,Secret;s founder returns with anti-loneliness app Ikaria,";I don;t feel good about that. That sucks,; Chrys Bader-Wechseler  reflects when asked about the bullying that went down on the anonymous app Secret he co-founded in 2013. After $35 million raised, 15 million users and a spectacular flame out two years later, the startup was dead. ;Since I left Secret I feel alive and aligned with my values and my purpose again.; But there was one bright side to Secret  letting you post without a name or consequences. People opened up, got vulnerable and felt less alone when comments revealed they weren;t the only person dealing with a certain struggle. What Bader learned from watching Secret;s users ;do this in the dark; was the realization that ;actually, we need to learn to do this in the light, to have that same kind of dialogue, but do it openly with each other.;So began the journey to Bader;s new startup Ikaria that;s exclusively revealing itself to the world today on TechCrunch. It;s a different kind of chat app, named after the Greek island where a close-knit community helps extend people;s lifespans. The six-person Santa Monica team is funded by a $1.5 million seed round led by Initialized Capital and Fuel Capital. People can sign up for early beta access here.During a long interview about the startup, Bader and his co-founder Sean Dadashi were cagey about exactly how Ikaria works, as it;s still in development. Amidst all the philosophical context about the app;s intention, I was able to pull out a few details about what the product will actually look like.;Basically, since 2004, technology has created this monumental shift in the human social experience. We;re more connected than ever technically but all the studies show we;re lonelier than ever,; Bader explains. ;It;s like eating McDonald;s to get healthy. It;s not the right source of nutrition for our social well-being because true connection requires a level of vulnerability, presence, self-disclosure and reciprocity that you don;t really get on these platforms.;Ikaria isn;t another feed. It;s a safe space where you can chat with close friends and family, or people going through similar life challenges. Members of these group chats will optionally go through guided experiences that help them reflect on and discuss what;s going on in their hearts and minds. This could become a whole new media format where outside creators or mental health professionals could produce and contribute their own guided experiences.;Part of the reason we;re announcing this is that . . . it;s a call to action to involve all these practitioners and people who are doing these types of things and giving them a platform to allow them to facilitate these kind of group bonding experiences through a platform where they can extend their practices into the digital world,; Bader tells me. What Calm and Headspace did for making meditation more mainstream and accessible, Ikaria wants to do for mental health through online togetherness.Ikaria already has a sizable closed beta going, which the startup plans to continue until it finds product fit, and it hopes to know its official release timeline by the end of the year. ;We;re not going to launch this until we know 40% of people would be disappointed if they couldn;t use it.;Rather than monetizing by exploiting people;s attention, Ikaria plans to develop a ;customer relationship; with users, which could mean subscription access or in-app payments for buying content. Perhaps one user could act as the sponsor and purchase an experience for their whole group chat. Until then, it;s got its seed funding from Initialized, Fuel Capital, F7 Ventures, Ryan Hoover;s Weekend Fund, Backend Capital, Day One Ventures, Shrug, Todd Goldberg and Superhuman;s Rahul Vohra.;The hope is that eventually this would be an app you use instead of iMessage, to increase your sense of presence,; Bader explains, revealing its grand ambitions. Why would we need to replace our core chat apps? Well for one thing, they don;t understand who really matters to you. If an app understood who your mom is, it could give her messages special prevalence or remind you to contact her.Bader met Dadashi through an offline men;s group for discussing life, love and everything in the wake of Secret;s collapse and a rough romantic breakup. After just a few weeks of these meetups, they say they felt closer to each other than to most of their friends. Only later did Bader, a designer by trade, discover that Dadashi was a coder who;d been CTO of electronics company MHD Enterprises before starting a travel and lifestyle startup for mental wellness, called Somatic Studios. They tried working together on an app for sharing quotes from your friends but scrapped it.Together, the pair went on to research the rapid rise of other vulnerability-focused meetup organizations like the one where they met, including Evryman, ManKind Project, Quilt, Authentic Relating, Circling, and T-Groups. Though they knew that to have a chance at impact at scale, they;d need to build a mobile app familiar enough to get people over the hurdle of starting a mindfulness practice. They laid out a few principles to build by: a focus on relationships instead of Likes and followers, conscious design that won;t exploit people;s attention or weaknesses, no ads, and keeping all data private and in control of the user.There are other startups hoping to address the sad state of mental health from different angles. Talkspace offers a mobile connection to licensed therapists, though it can be pricey at $65 to $99 per week. 7 Cups and TalkLife makes peer-to-peer counseling from volunteers free, though these aren;t professionals. There are also plenty of journaling products, gratitude practice apps and wellness podcasts out there. But Ikaria;s approach, combining mental health content with group chats of people you trust, feels unique.Having known Bader since the Secret days, it;s obvious that working with Dadashi has made him happier and more centered. Ikaria is an app he can wake up feeling good about each day. ;You know, I don;t like to speak ill of David [Byttow, Secret;s CEO who sources say was verbally abusive to employees], but that relationship was very, very toxic and taxing for me. And this time around with Sean, as I;m sure you can tell, is the polar opposite.;If Ikaria can help people develop the open and honest relationships with friends or peers like building it has done for Bader and Dadashi, it could be a beacon amidst a sea of time unwell spent.",https://tcrn.ch/2HBISgk
1947711,2020-02-18T09:33:07,InVideo raises $2.5M and launches an automated assistant to make your videos better,"Video editing startup InVideo has new funding and a new product.The San Francisco-headquartered company bills itself as the easiest way for anyone to create professional-quality videos, using a drag-and-drop interface along with a library of templates and stock photos and videos. The resulting videos can then be optimized for Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and other platforms.InVideo;s  new assistant does even more to help with the process. As demonstrated for me by co-founder and CEO Sanket Shah, as you create a video, it automatically makes suggestions for how the video could be improved — he compared it to Grammarly, but for video.Shah said the assistant currently focuses on two areas, both text-related. First, it;s making sure that all the text on the screen is readable — so that, for example, you don;t have light-colored text on a light background. Second, it;s making sure the text is ;comprehensible; — so that there;s not too much text on the screen, or it;s not flashing by too quickly.;We all think that design is very creative, but there;s a lot of science in it as well,; he said.Shah told me InVideo;s founders first worked together on a startup aiming to create 10-minute video summaries of nonfiction books. That;s when they discovered ;video creation is a very painful process, it;s just not scalable.; So they launched the current startup hoping to solve this problem.The company says it now has 100,000 customers — including AT&amp;T, Sony Music, Reuters, CNN and CNBC — in 150 countries.It might seem surprising for a large media company to need to use a tool like this, but Shah explained, ;The users who use us [at those large companies] today are not video editors. If you want to constantly create videos about the U.S. elections, it;s not a video editor who;s doing it, it;s very likely a news producer; with limited or nonexistent editing experience.Pricing for the editor starts at $10 per month, though there;s also a free version if you don;t mind watermarks.InVideo is also announcing that it has raised an additional $2.5 million in funding from Sequoia Capital India’s  Surge, along with angel investors Anand Chandrasekaran and Gokul Rajaram. It has now raised a total of $3.2 million.;InVideo has truly captured the imagination of our users with their super user-friendly online video editor and great customer support,; said Ayman Al-Abdullah, CEO and president of software deals website AppSumo, in a statement. “In fact, it has gone on to become the most sold product in AppSumo history.;Trash uses AI to edit your footage into a fun, short videos",https://tcrn.ch/3bS66Ng
1947692,2020-02-18T09:10:32,"Aisera, an AI tool to help with customer service and internal operations, exits stealth with $50M","Robotic process automation ; the ability to automate certain repetitive software-based tasks to free up people to focus on work that computers cannot do ; has become a major growth area in the world of IT. Today, a startup called Aisera that is coming out of stealth has taken this idea and supercharged it by using artificial intelligence to help not just workers with internal tasks, but in customer-facing environments, too.Quietly operating under the radar since 2017, Aisera  has picked up a significant list of customers, including Autodesk, Ciena, Unisys and McAfee ; covering a range of use cases from ;computer geeks with very complicated questions through to people who didn’t grow up in the computer generation,; says CEO Muddu Sudhakar, the serial entrepreneur (three previous startups, Kazeon, Cetas and Caspida, were respectively acquired by EMC, VMware and Splunk) who is Aisera;s co-founder.With growth of 350% year-on-year, the company is also announcing today that it has raised $50 million to date, including most recently a $20 million Series B led by Norwest Venture Partners with Menlo Ventures, True Ventures, Khosla Ventures, First Round Capital, Ram Shriram and Maynard Webb Investments also participating.(No valuation is being disclosed, said Sudhakar.)The crux of the problem that Aisera has set out to solve is that, while RPA has identified that there is a degree of repetition in certain back-office tasks ; which, if that work can be automated, can reduce operational costs and be more efficient for an organization ; the same can be said for a wide array of IT processes that cover sales, HR, customer care and more.There have been some efforts made to apply AI to solving different aspects of these particular use cases, but one of the issues has been that there are few solutions that sit above an organization;s software stack to work across everything that the organization uses, and does so in an ;unsupervised; way ; that is, uses AI to ;learn; processes without having an army of engineers alongside the program training it.Aisera aims to be that platform, integrating with the most popular software packages (for example in service desk apps, it integrates with Salesforce, ServiceNow, Atlassian and BMC), providing tools to automatically resolve queries and complete tasks. Aisera is looking to add more categories as it grows: Sudhakar mentioned legal, finance and facilities management as three other areas it;s planning to target.Matt Howard, the partner at Norwest that led its investment in Aisera, said one of the other things that stands out for him about the company is that its tools work across multiple channels, including email, voice-based calls and messaging, and can operate at scale, something that can;t be said in actual fact for a lot of AI implementations.;I think a lot of companies have overstated when they implement machine learning. A lot of times it’s actually big data and predictive analytics. We have mislabeled a lot of this,; he said in an interview. ;AI as a rule is hard to maintain if it;s unsupervised. It can work every well in a narrow use case, but it becomes a management nightmare when handling the stress that comes with 15 million or 20 million queries.; Currently Aisera said that it handles about 10 million people on its platform. With this round, Howard and Jon Callaghan of True Ventures are both joining the board.There is always a paradox of sorts in the world of AI, and in particular as it sits around and behind processes that have previously been done by humans. It is that AI-based assistants, as they get better, run the risk of ultimately making obsolete the workers they;re meant to help.While that might be a long-term question that we will have to address as a society, for now, the reward/risk balance seems to tip more in the favour of reward for Aisera;s customers. “At Ciena, we want our employees to be productive,” said Craig Williams, CIO at Ciena, in a statement. “This means they shouldn’t be trying to figure out how a ticketing tool works, nor should they be waiting around for a tech to fix their issues. We believe that 75 percent of all incidents can be resolved through Aisera’s technology, and we believe we can apply Aisera across multiple platforms. Aisera doesn’t just make great AI technology, they understand our problems and partner with us closely to achieve our mission.”And Sudhakar ; similar to the founders of startups that are would-be competitors like UiPath when asked the same kind of question ; doesn;t feel that obsolescence is the end game, either.;There are billions of people in call centres today,; he said in an interview. ;If I can automate [repetitive] functions they can focus on higher-level work, and that’s what we wanted to do. Those trying to solve simple requests shouldn;t. It;s one example where AI can be put to good use. Help desk employees want to work and become programmers, they don;t want to do mundane tasks. They want to move up in their careers, and this can help give them the roadmap to do it.;",https://tcrn.ch/2P7TGae

1947693,2020-02-18T08:26:48,Kickstarter workers vote to unionize,"Kickstarter today announced that its staff has decided to unionize. The move reflects a broader movement for worker representation among tech employees. The site joins a growing list of companies whose staff and/or contractors have expressed public interest in unionizing, including Spin, Instacart and Pittsburgh-based Google technical workers, along with media outlets like BuzzFeed and Vox. The decision, which was approved through a 46 to 37 vote, comes on the heels of pushback from Kickstarter leadership. As noted in a piece published by Vice late last year, CEO Aziz Hassan called employees’ push to unionize “inherently adversarial” in a letter to staff, adding:That dynamic doesn’t reflect who we are as a company, how we interact, how we make decisions, or where we need to go. We believe that in many ways it would set us back, and that the us vs. them binary already has. In a statement provided to TechCrunch this morning, however, the executive appears to have had a change of heart. “We support and respect this decision, and we are proud of the fair and democratic process that got us here,” Hassan writes. “We’ve worked hard over the last decade to build a different kind of company, one that measures its success by how well it achieves its mission: helping to bring creative projects to life. Our mission has been common ground for everyone here during this process, and it will continue to guide us as we enter this new phase together.”As part of the National Labor Relations Board vote, Kickstarter  United will now be recognized by management of the Brooklyn-based crowdfunding giant. This marks the first time a major tech company;s full-time, white-collar employees have unionized in such a manner.",https://tcrn.ch/2vNf5yk

The taxi operator;s holding company disclosed in a regulatory filing earlier this month that it had sold 108 million shares of Blue Bird at 3,800 rupiahs (about 28 cents) to an undisclosed buyer. The company already offered reservations for Blue Bird taxis on its super-app, and the investment brings the two closer.Gojek’s ;super-app,; called that because it offers a wide range of services, including on-demand rides and deliveries, a payment service, streaming entertainment and home cleaning, competes against Grab, which announced last July that it will use $2 billion of the funding it raised from SoftBank to invest in Indonesian transportation infrastructure and businesses.While Gojek and Grab compete in several markets, Gojek is currently the biggest player in Indonesia.TechCrunch has contacted Gojek for comment.SoftBank pumps $2B into Indonesia through Grab investment, putting it head to head with Gojek",https://tcrn.ch/2SQJ5kU
1947074,2020-02-17T23:00:15,SumUp launches Mastercard-powered ;SumUp Card; for business payments,"SumUp, the London-based fintech company that enables small businesses to take card payments via its device and online, is launching its own pre-paid card in partnership with Mastercard.Dubbed ;SumUp  Card,; the new offering will enable merchants to gain quicker to access funds collected via SumUp as it will no longer require money to be transferred out to a third-party bank account first.The idea ; and especially useful for cash-flow constrained micro-businesses ; is that the new card can be used for all business payments. In addition, SumUp merchants have access to other benefits, such as guaranteed next-day payouts (including on weekends) and low FX rates. It means SumUp now covers collecting and making payments, evolving into a banking app of sorts.The SumUp Card, which supports online, contactless, and Chip-and-PIN payments, has no upfront cost or monthly fee. It is available immediately in the U.K., Italy and France, with plans to extend the service to further territories in the next 12 months.;SumUp Card is a beneficial tool for merchants to get their payouts quicker, including on weekends, and control the cash flow,; a SumUp spokesperson tells TechCrunch. ;It also allows merchants to have an overview of their finances in one place. Merchants can further keep money on the card and use it for paying business expenses, separating personal and business cash flows;.More broadly, the pain point SumUp is trying to solve is that working capital is one of the biggest costs for small businesses, and by allowing them to shorten their cash cycles, it aims to help those businesses become more viable.;Following feedback from SumUp merchants, it was clear that quicker payments and uninterrupted access to funds were particularly important to those running a micro-business, and who may not be able to open a traditional business account,; adds the spokesperson.;The cost associated with opening a business account at a traditional bank is prohibitive for the small merchants as banks avoid serving this segment and are not able to do so profitably. In our merchant interviews, we heard feedback from a U.K. merchant that getting a business bank account is like getting married: as soon as you say it’s a wedding the cost doubles. SumUp Card allows these merchants to separate their personal accounts from their day-to-day business, removing friction in the process;.",https://tcrn.ch/2SQGU0R

In mid-2018, it had 150 million MAUs and raised $200 million from Goldman Sachs, yet I;ve never heard anyone mention the company.

If it can do it, how can similar strategies apply to other products?But first, some background: What is Voodoo Games?Voodoo is best described as a product conglomerate.

1946461,2020-02-17T14:54:26,GGV Capital says mom-and-pop shops can boost e-commerce in emerging markets,"Despite the rapid growth of e-commerce in India, Southeast Asia and other emerging markets, the vast majority of retail transactions there still happen offline in small stores that also serve as neighborhood hubs.The central role these stores play in their communities led GGV Capital  to develop what the firm refers to as its mom-and-pop shop investment thesis. This means backing startups that help small retailers digitize operations, tap into better supply chains and serve as delivery points in markets where logistics and online payment infrastructures are still developing. In turn, GGV;s managing partners believe this will lay the groundwork for stronger e-commerce growth.Companies that GGV has already invested in under this thesis include B2B e-commerce platform Udaan and Telio, bookkeeping app KhataBook and social commerce startup Shihuituan (also called Nice Tuan) in China.A sociological approach to e-commerce investmentGGV managing partner Hans Tung says the mom-and-pop shop thesis means looking at consumers’ shopping habits across countries and understanding why they are different from a historical and social perspective. During his career, Tung has observed e-commerce develop in markets including the United States, China, Japan, Taiwan, India, Southeast Asia and Latin America. Offline shopping habits, population density, transportation infrastructure and credit card penetration all played a factor in how e-commerce evolved in each of those places.;You realize e-commerce doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It exists as a substitute for what is happening in the offline world,; he says. ;Mobile payment doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It just fulfills the same needs with a different method. It was a substitution for what was happening in the offline world with credit card and debit card penetration.;",https://tcrn.ch/3bJgiY9
1947433,2020-02-17T14:11:35,So much for pessimism,"After WeWork exploded there was — at least supposedly — a change in sentiment among investors and founders alike. Gone were the days of easy nine-figure rounds, expensive growth, negative unit economics and the rest of the excess that Startupland has enjoyed over the past half-decade.Inside this purported sentiment shift, I presumed, was a decrease in optimism; surely venture capitalists and entrepreneurs would change their behavior inside this new paradigm?But by some measures, they haven;t. I expected that startups would achieve more conservative proximate valuations in the post-WeWork  world, as their leaders would aim to raise a bit less, and a bit more conservatively, and investors would be less starry-eyed in the prices they were willing to pay for startup equity.That was all wrong, it turns out. A recent report from Fenwick and West, a legal firm that works with technology companies, paints a picture that is the complete opposite of what we might have anticipated.Perhaps we shouldn;t be surprised; our recent reporting hardly describes a market in slowdown. Boston is having a good start to the year, for example. SaaS is also looking healthy from a venture capital perspective. Cloud stocks are at all-time highs and One Medical is still defying gravity as a public stock. Whatever lesson WeWork was supposed to teach, it doesn;t appear to have made much impact.Let;s explore the Fenwick data and then ask if we can spot anywhere where the markets are behaving like the chastened children that we were told had taken over.Up and to the right",https://tcrn.ch/3bMWUJK
1947356,2020-02-17T12:49:39,Rippling starts billboard battle with Gusto,"Remember when Zenefits  imploded, and kicked out CEO Parker Conrad. Well, Conrad launched a new employee onboarding startup called Rippling, and now he;s going after another HR company called Gusto with a new billboard, ;Outgrowing Gusto?  Presto change-o.;The problem is, Gusto got it taken down by issuing a cease &amp; desist order to Rippling and the billboard operator Clear Channel Outdoor. That;s despite the law typically allowing comparative advertising as long as it;s accurate. Gusto sells HR, benefits and payroll software, while Rippling  does the same but adds in IT management to tie together an employee identity platform.Rippling tells me that outgrowing Gusto is the top reasons customers say they;re switching to Rippling. Gusto;s customer stories page lists no customers larger than 61 customers, and Enlyft research says the company is most often used by 10 to 50-person staffs. ;We were one of Gusto;s largest customers when we left the platform last year. They were very open about the fact that the product didn;t work for businesses of our size. We moved to Rippling last fall and have been extremely happy with it,; says Compass Coffee co-founder Michael Haft.That all suggests the Rippling ad;s claim is reasonable. But the C&amp;D claims that ;Gusto counts as customers multiple companies with 100 or more employees and does not state the businesses will ;outgrow; their platfrom at a certain size.;In an email to staff provided to TechCrunch, Rippling CMO Matt Epstein wrote, ;We take legal claims seriously, but this one doesn;t pass the laugh test. As Gusto says all over their website, they focus on small businesses.;So rather than taking Gusto to court or trying to change Clear Channel;s mind, Conrad and Rippling did something cheeky. They responded to the cease &amp; desist order in Shakespeare-style iambic pentameter.Our billboard struck a nerve, it seems. And so you phoned your legal teams,who started shouting, “Cease!” “Desist!” and other threats too long to list.Your brand is known for being chill. So this just seems like overkill.But since you think we’ve been unfair, we’d really like to clear the air.Rippling;s general counsel Vanessa Wu wrote the letter, which goes on to claim that ;When Gusto tried to scale itself, we saw what you took off the shelf. Your software fell a little short. You needed Workday for support,; asserting that Gusto;s own HR tool couldn;t handle its 1,000-plus employees and needed to turn to a bigger enterprise vendor. The letter concludes with the implication that Gusto should drop the cease-and-desist, and instead compete on merit:So Gusto, do not fear our sign. Our mission and our goals align.Let’s keep this conflict dignified—and let the customers decide.Rippling CMO Matt Epstein tells me that ;While the folks across the street may find competition upsetting, customers win when companies push each other to do better. We hope our lighthearted poem gets this debate back down to earth, and we look forward to competing in the marketplace.;    Rippling&#x27;s rhyming response to Gusto&#x27;s cease &amp; desist order  from Josh Constine Rippling might think this whole thing was slick or funny, but it comes off a bit lame and try-hard. These are far from 8 Mile-worthy battle rhymes. If it really wanted to let customers decide, it could have just accepted the C&amp;D and moved on;or not run the billboard at all. It still has four others that don;t slam competitors running. That said, Gusto does look petty trying to block the billboard and hide that it;s unequipped to support massive teams.We reached out to Gusto over the weekend and again today asking for comment, whether it will drop the C&amp;D, if it;s trying to get Rippling;s bus ads dropped too and if it does in fact use Workday internally.[Update 2pm Pacific: Gusto;s PR representative Paul Loeffler claims that ;This is common business practice in maintaining a brand;, says that for Gusto ;A core, but not exclusive focus, are small businesses;, and admits that ;as Gusto itself has grown to become a large-scale company, we have different needs than many of our customers and transitioned to Workday.;Finally, he declares that ;We’re excited to see more companies create new solutions that make it easier for businesses to take care of and support their teams; despite theatening to sue one that was. If Gusto itself grew out of Gusto, an ad asking if its customers are too seems wholly accurate.]Given Gusto has raised $516 million ; 10X what Rippling has ; you;d think it could just outspend Rippling on advertising or invest in building the enterprise HR tools so customers really couldn;t outgrow it. They;re both Y Combinator companies with Kleiner Perkins as a major investor (conflict of interest?), so perhaps they can still bury the hatchet.At least they found a way to make the HR industry interesting for an afternoon.Rippling raises $45M at $270M to be the biz app identity layerSMB payroll startup Gusto raises $200M Series D, plans R&#038;D expansion to NYC",https://tcrn.ch/2SzY1Vx

1947151,2020-02-17T08:58:28,Boston;s year jump starts as two local startups raise $520M in two rounds,"Hello and welcome back to our regular morning look at private companies, public markets and the gray space in between.Late last week two Boston-based companies raised big rounds. The size of the two investments — each over the $100 million mark — and their rapid succession made them stand out.The pair of investments raised a question: Is Boston seeing an acceleration in the pace at which it attracts venture capital? Of course, Toast raising $400 million and Flywire  raising $120 million within a day of each other does not, by itself, constitute a trend. So we;ve pulled some recent, and historical data from Boston to figure out what;s up.Today let;s take a look at how many rounds of $50 million or more, and $100 million or more, have been raised in Boston so far in 2020 compared to the city;s full-year 2019 results from each category. We;ll be able to see if Boston is ahead of the pace it set last year. This will let us know if Boston;s venture scene is heating up, or cooling thus far in 2020. (Recall that we wrote about the Northeast in December, and found its venture activity to be intense.)We;ll start with a quick peek at the Flywire and Toast rounds, and then dig into the data.Winged BreadToast, Boston;s restaurant payment processing unicorn, put together $400 million in fresh funding last week, adding to its preceding haul of just over $500 million in known capital. The company, founded in 2011, has now raised $902 million, according to Crunchbase.",https://tcrn.ch/2SQkehc
1946625,2020-02-17T08:30:32,MotoRefi raises $8.6 million to bring its auto refinancing platform to the masses,"Americans are saddled with $1.2 trillion in auto loans, according to data collected by the Federal Reserve. And while that debt can be refinanced, even U.S. car owners who know it;s an option face a complicated task.MotoRefi, a new fintech startup that was born out of QED Investors in 2017, says it has developed an auto refinancing platform that handles the entire process, from rooting out the best rates to paying off the old lender and re-titling the vehicle.Now, the company is preparing to scale up and bring its platform to the masses, with $8.6 million in capital raised in a Series A funding round co-led by Accomplice  and Link Ventures. Motley Fool Ventures, CMFG Ventures (part of CUNA Mutual Group) and Gaingels also participated in the round. The round follows $4.7 million in seed funding that MotoRefi  announced in March 2019.MotoRefi is also gaining two new board members, Rob Chaplinsky, managing director of Link Ventures,  and Rachel Holt, former Uber executive and co-founder of a new VC firm, Construct Capital.Auto loan debt is the same as student loan debt in the U.S., said MotoRefi CEO Kevin Bennett. And yet the majority of car owners don;t know that refinancing their auto loan is even an option, he added. A 2017 Harris Poll found that 47% of Americans were aware they could refinance their auto loan.;People shop their home loans, while most just get their auto loans from the dealership where they bought their car, so their rates are artificially high,; Bennett said in a recent interview. ;Meanwhile, credit unions can be great for auto loans but they might not have the tools to reach consumers.;That;s where MotoRefi hopes to step in. Bennett said the MotoRefi platform can save customers an average of $100 per month on their car payments.Holt, who was an early investor in MotoRefi, said during her time at Uber she saw firsthand the amount of auto loans drivers were carrying. Dealerships aren;t making money on selling cars, they;re making it on financing, Holt said. ;I saw this problem and so I was looking out for startups trying to solve this problem,; she added.The U.S. auto refinancing market is about $40 billion, according to TransUnion. But that market could be two to three times that size, according to data shared at TransUnion Financial Services Summit. It;s an opportunity that has prompted companies like Lending Tree to launch auto refinancing products.MotoRefi is already scaling up by adding new lenders and partners, according to Bennett. The new funding will be used to hire more employees and invest in its technology platform.The startup also launched in January separate pilot programs with Progressive and Chime. Under these pilots, Progressive and Chime will directly offer refinance options to their customers in addition to working with affiliate programs such as Credit Karma — a company backed by QED Investors.",https://tcrn.ch/2HyKR53

1947113,2020-02-17T06:13:32,Startup buys startup: PullRequest snags remote developer hiring platform Moonlight,"PullRequest, a startup that provides code review as a service, announced today that it was buying Moonlight, an early-stage startup that has built an online platform for hiring remote developers. The companies did not share the terms.Lyal Avery, founder and CEO at PullRequest,  says he bought this company to expand his range of services. ;Our platform is at a place where we;re very confident about our ability to identify issues. We;re moving to the next phase of fixing issues automatically. In order to do that, we have to have access to people producing code. So with the developers on our platform that are currently reviewers, as well as the Moonlight folks, we can start to fix the issues we identify, and also attach that to our learning processes,; Avery explained.This fits with the company;s vision of eventually automating common fixes. It;s currently working on building machine learning models to facilitate that automation. Moonlight  gives PullRequest access to the platform;s data, which can help train and perfect the beta models on which the company is working.Avery says his vision isn;t to replace human developers so much as to make them faster and more efficient than they are today. He says that from the time a bug is found in website code to the time it gets fixed is on average about six hours. He wants to reduce that to 20 minutes, and he believes that buying Moonlight will give him more data to get to that goal faster, while also expanding the range of services from code review to issue remediation.It;s fairly unusual for a startup that has raised just over $12 million (according to Crunchbase data) to be out shopping for another, but Avery sees buying small companies like Moonlight as an excellent way to fill in gaps in the platform, while offering an easier path to expansion.Moonlight is a small shop with just two employees, both who will be joining PullRequest, but it has 3,000 developers on the platform, which PullRequest can now access. For now, Avery says the companies will remain separate, and Moonlight will continue to operate its own website under the PullRequest umbrella.Moonlight is based in Brooklyn; it had raised an unidentified pre-seed round before being acquired today. PullRequest, which is based in Austin, was a member of the Y Combinator Summer 2017 cohort. It raised a $2.3 million seed round in December, 2017 and another $8 million in April, 2018.PullRequest pulls in $8M Series A just months after scoring seed round",https://tcrn.ch/2uJraVv
1947005,2020-02-16T22:43:57,"Oyo;s revenue surged in FY19, but its loss widened, too","On Monday, budget-lodging startup Oyo reported a loss of $335 million on $951 million revenue globally for the financial year ending March 31, 2019, and pledged to cut down on its spending as the India-headquartered firm grows cautious about its aggressive expansion.The six-year-old startup;s growing revenue, up from $211 million in financial year ending March 31, 2018 (FY18), is in line with the company;s ambitions to be in a clear path to profitability this year, said Abhishek Gupta, Global CFO of OYO Hotels &amp; Homes, in a statement.But the startup;s loss has widened, too. Its consolidated loss at $335 million in FY19 rose over sixfold from $52 million in FY18. In India, where Oyo clocked $604 million in revenue in FY19 (up 2.9X since FY18), it was able to reduce its loss to 14 percent (from 24 percent) of revenue in FY19 to $83 million.Indian laws require every local startup ; and international businesses ; to disclose their annual financials. Most of them filed their financials in early October.The startup, which today operates more than 43,000 hotels with over a million rooms in 800 cities in 80 nations, said its expansion in China and other international markets contributed to the loss. Oyo entered China in 2018, and says the world;s most populated nation has already become its second largest market.;These markets constituted 36.5 percent of the global revenues. While consistently improving operating economics in mature markets like India where it;s already seeing an improvement in gross margins, the company is determined to bring in the same fiscal discipline in emerging markets in the coming financial year,; the startup said in a statement.Aditya Ghosh, who served as a chief executive of the startup and is now a board member, said in a call with reporters that since Oyo entered a number of markets last year it was in the growth phase and that needed some investments. Speaking especially of China, Ghosh said the company, like many others, is watching the outbreak of coronavirus that has resulted in shutting down some hotels.He also said that Oyo has pared back from some markets, including India, where it pulled out of about 200 cities. The startup is currently not looking to expand to any new markets, he added.It is now working on improving its gross margin. In India, its gross margin increased to 14.7% from 10.6% as of FY18.Oyo;s growth in international marketsOyo has come under scrutiny in recent months for its aggressive expansion in a manner that some analysts have said is not sustainable. The startup, which rebrands and renovates independent budget hotels, has also engaged in sketchy ways to sign up new hotels, as documented by the New York Times earlier this year. Several hoteliers have claimed that Oyo did not honor its agreements and owed them money.In 2019, Oyo, which counts Airbnb among its investors, expanded in Europe and the U.S. among other markets. It bought Leisure Group from Axel Springer for $415 million to target Europe’s vacation rental market. It also announced plans to invest another $335 million for this effort. In the same month, it announced it had acquired the Hooters Casino Hotel Las Vegas for about $135 million in its first U.S. property purchase.It also entered Japan in a partnership with SoftBank. Bloomberg reported on Sunday that Oyo currently has about 12,000 rooms in the country, far fewer than its ambitious 1 million target.In recent months, Oyo executives have acknowledged that the startup grew too fast and is confronting a number of ;teething issues.; Oyo has laid off at least 3,000 employees, mostly in India, in last three months. Ghosh said the startup is still hiring for new roles, but only in key areas such as data science.;The company’s increased focus on corporate governance and building a high-performing and employee-first work culture will also drive this next phase of sustainable growth for us,; said Gupta.",https://tcrn.ch/2UXgux6
1946919,2020-02-15T10:35:15,Startups Weekly: A pre-IPO list of unicorn companies that also generate lots of revenue(!),"[Editor’s note: Want to get this weekly review of news that startups can use by email? Just subscribe here.] My colleague Alex Wilhelm has been researching the companies that are both getting impressive valuations and also generating annual recurring revenues of around $100 million on more. These are the sorts of companies that any savvy public-market tech investor might want to take a closer look at, particularly the sort of investor who is comfortable digesting modern online subscription metrics. That is, the startup-oriented types who read this kinda newsletter.The following is not investment advice, but this week Alex added Seismic, ThoughtSpot, Noom, Riskified and Movable Ink to the club, based on their funding histories, growth metrics and his own interviews with the teams. ;Perhaps we’re really just compiling an IPO watchlist, a grouping of firms that will probably go (or should go) public in the next 18 months,; he mused along the way.He then assembled a list of the dozen existing companies he;s covered in the last few months that form ;The $100M ARR Club.; Read the full thing on Extra Crunch, and get ready for more coverage as the hundreds of unicorns produced in this era continue running the public gauntlet.Raising a seed round? You have more options in 2020You have more options than ever if you want to raise a seed round today. But you have to know how to pitch the right investors at the right time.In recent years investors have come up with more ways to back companies that are still finding product-market fit or still figuring out how to grow. But there are approximately six stages of seed today — and each investor who writes these sorts of checks has their own preferences within the stages. Some are fine with just a big idea, some want to see the start of long-term traction.So! Our resident former VC, Danny Crichton, has put together for Extra Crunch the latest tips that he;s hearing from founders and early-stage investors about the following stages of young companies:0. Team – deck: This might be dubbed the “hello world” stage of a startup’s journey. There is at least one person looking to build some form of company, but the full team, product, market and target aren’t fleshed out at all.1. Team + deck: In this stage, there is leadership for the startup and the founder(s) have identified a working hypothesis for a product or at least a market they want to tackle. Because there is no product, there is obviously no product-market fit (PMF).2. On course to product-market fit: There is a real product, there are users, maybe even a bit of revenue, but everything is sort of ambiguous and the team is still actively experimenting and testing ideas around the product.3. Product-market fit, pre-scaling: The startup has identified and developed a product that has clear signs of product-market fit, which might come in the form of high NPS scores, strong word-of-mouth marketing, excited feedback from users or some other data that says users of the product love it.4. On course to scalable growth: There is a product people love, but now the company needs to prove it knows how to spend money to buy growth. This means setting up marketing channels, handling growth marketing within the product itself (on-boarding, sharing tools, etc.) and, if relevant, building out a sales team. Many of these functions haven’t been fully tested by the startup yet.5. Proven, if early growth: Growth channels have real and positive data that’s comparable with other startups.This list is focused on funding for venture-oriented companies — he;ll be exploring the booming world of alternative finance in the coming weeks.

1946951,2020-02-15T09:55:30,The drunken HQ Trivia finale before it shut down was insane,";Not gonna lie. This f*cking sucks. This is the last HQ ever!,; yelled host Matt Richards . And it just got crazier from there.The farewell game of HQ Trivia before it shut down last night was a beautiful disaster. The hosts cursed, sprayed champagne, threatened to defecate on the homes of trolls in the chat window and begged for new jobs. Imagine Jeopardy, but Trebek is hyped-up and blacked-out.Yesterday HQ Trivia ran out of money, laid off its 25 employees and shut down. It was in talks to be acquired, but the buyer pulled out last-minute and investors weren;t willing to pour any money into the sagging game show. It had paid out $6 million in prizes from its $15 million-plus in venture capital since launching in late 2017.HQ Trivia shuts down after acquisition falls throughBut HQ was in steady decline since February 2018, when it peaked at more than 2.3 million concurrent players ; to just tens of thousands recently. The games grew repetitive, prize money was split between too many winners, co-founder Colin Kroll passed away, original host and quiz daddy Scott Rogowsky was let go, the startup;s staff failed in an attempt to mutiny and oust the CEO and layoffs ensued. You can read how it all went down here.But rather than wither away, the momentary cultural phenemenon went out with a bang. ;Should HQ trivia shut down? No? Yes? Or f*ck no!; Richards cackled.You can watch the final show here, and we;ve laid out some of Richards; and co-host Anna Roisman;s choicest quotes from HQ;s last game:;If you just got here, this is HQ Trivia. It;s a live mobile game show. We;re gonna read about 34 questions and then you;re gonna win about 2 cents and you;re gonna fucking loooooove it.; -Roisman;This $5 prize is coming out of my own pocket. We ran out of money. We just kept giving it away. We gave it all to the players, to you, you loyal HQties.; -Richards;Take this time now to buy some extra lives. You never know when you;re going to need them. I wish we had an extra life for the company. I;m sorry. I f*cking can;t. I;m gonna cry. My dogs eat $200 worth of food a day. My dogs are gonna starve.; -Richards;Why are we shutting down? I don;t know. Ask our investors. What am I going to do with my fish tank? I think our investors ran out of money.; -Richards;Who likes healthy snacks! That;s why the investors stopped giving us money, because there wasn;t any f*cking snacks in this b*tch. We were snackless. Who the fuck can work in a place without snacks!; -Richards;I met a couple who told me HQ is part of their foreplay.; -Richards;Who;s going to miss the HQ chat? I;m going to miss all those people telling me I don;t have eyebrows or to do the Carlton.; -Richards;Maybe we should close every night. These are the nicest f*cking comments I;ve ever seen.

1946806,2020-02-14T14:38:09,HQ Trivia shuts down after acquisition falls through,"HQ Trivia is dead. Today the company laid off its full staff of 25 and will cease operation of its trivia, sports and word guessing games, a source close to the company confirmed. You can watch the insane, drunken final episode hereHQ Trivia had a deal in the works to be acquired, but the buyer pulled out yesterday and investors aren;t willing to fund it any longer, CEO and co-founder Rus Yusupov  said in a statement attained by CNN Business; Kerry Flynn:;We received an offer from an established business to acquire HQ and continue building our vision, had definitive agreements and legal docs, and a projected closing date of tomorrow, and for reasons we are still investigating, they suddenly changed their position and despite our best efforts, we were unable to reach an agreement,; Yusupov writes. ;Unfortunately, our lead investors are no longer willing to fund the company, and so effective today, HQ will cease operations and move to dissolution. All employees and contractors will be terminated as of today.;With HQ we showed the world the future of TV. We didn’t get to where we hoped but we did stretch the world’s imagination for what’s possible on our smartphones. Thanks to everyone who helped build this and thanks for playing.&mdash; Rus (@rus) February 14, 2020Launched in October 2017, TechCrunch wrote the first coverage of the 12-question live video trivia game started by two of the former Vine founders. Users could win real money by answering all the questions and not being eliminated in multiple daily games. HQ Trivia had raised more than $15 million, including a Series A led by Founders Fund. At one point it had more than 2.3 million concurrent players.But eventually the novelty began to wear off. Cheaters came in, splitting the prize money down to just a few dollars or cents per winner. Copycats emerged internationally. Engineering issues led users to get kicked out of the game.Then tragedy struck. Co-founder Colin Kroll passed away. That exacerbated internal problems at HQ Trivia. Product development was slow, leading users to grow tired of the game. New game types and viral features materialized too late.A failed internal mutiny saw staffers prepare to petition the board to remove Yusupov from the CEO position. When he caught wind of the plot, organizers of the revolt were fired. Morale sunk. By July 2019, downloads were just 8% of their previous year;s, and 20% of the staff was laid off. HQ managed about 15 million all-time installs, peaking at 2 million in February 2018, while last month it had just 67,000, according to Sensor Tower.Mutiny at HQ Trivia fails to oust CEOThe demise of HQ Trivia demonstrates the fickle nature of the gaming industry, and the startup scene as a whole. Momentary traction is no guarantee of future success. Products must continually evolve and adapt to their audience to stay relevant. And executives must forge ahead while communicating clearly with their teams, even amongst uncertainty, or find their companies withered by the rapid passing of time.The drunken HQ Trivia finale before it shut down was insane",https://tcrn.ch/2Swhabb
1946734,2020-02-14T12:26:59,Tinder founder funds sex tips app Lover,"Want to spice up the bedroom without paying for pills or awkward visits to a sex therapist? A new app called Lover lets you take a sexual personality quiz, explore carnal knowledge tutorials and discretely figure out which turn-ons you share with your partner. Built by board-certified sexual medicine clinical psychologist Dr. Britney Blair, Lover launches today on iOS with $5 million in seed funding from Tinder founder Sean Rad and other investors.;It is strange that there are such taboos around sex when it is something we all do…whether we enjoy ourselves or not. We think it is time to start the conversation around this important aspect of our health,; says Dr. Blair. ;We believe Lover can help build confidence, facilitate communication, improve partner connection and just raise consciousness about sex and sexuality.;A solid portion of Lover;s content is free for the first seven days, including audio guides to oral sex, video explainers on how to be generous in bed and multi-step ;playlists; of content like ;Getting Hard, Made Easy.; Lover charges $9.99 per month or $59.99 per year for continued access to themed educational materials like ;Coreplay Not Foreplay; and ;Fantasy To Reality; that are recommended based on the results of your sexual questionnaire. ;Almost 50% of women and 40% of men have a sexual complaint . . . [but] most people don’t realize how common and treatable their issues are,; Dr. Blair tells me. ;In our [pre-launch tests] focused purely on erectile dysfunction, 62% of users reported improvements to their erections within three weeks of using the app. That’s pretty wild when you think Viagra’s efficacy rate is approximately 65% and it lasts only five hours.;Startups like digital pharmacy Ro have scored $500 million valuations just 18 months after launch by prescribing and selling men;s health drugs like Viagra. Lover sees a market for education-based alternative approaches to sexual wellness.Lover co-founders (from left): Jas Bagniewski, Dr. Britney Blair and Nick PendleDr. Blair got interested in the space a decade ago after a Stanford grad school lecture illuminated how prevalent sexual problems are but how quickly they can be resolved with learning and communication. She teamed up with her CEO Jas Bagniewski, who;d been the manager of Europe;s largest e-commerce business, Zalando in the U.K., and a founder of City Deal that sold to Groupon. Bagniewski and fellow Lover co-founder Nick Pendle started European Casper mattress competitor Eve Sleep and brought it to IPO.The plan is to combine Dr. Blair;s educational materials with Bagniewski and Pendle;s e-commerce chops to monetize Lover through subscriptions and eventually recommending products like sex toys for purchase. Now they have $5 million in seed funding led by Lerer Hippeau, and joined by Manta Ray Ventures, Oliver Samwer;s Global Founders Capital, Fabrice Grinda and Jose Marin. The cash will go toward building out an Android app and adding games that partners can play together in bed.There are plenty of random sex tip websites out there. Lover tries to differentiate itself by personalizing content based on the results of a Myers-Briggs-esque quiz. This asks you how adventurous, communicative and assertive you are. You then receive a classification like ;The Muse; with a few pages of explanation, for example, revealing how you like to inspire others while being the center of attention.From there, Lover can suggest guides for mastering your own sexual personality or branching out into new behavior patterns. There;s also a feature copied from another app called XConfessions for figuring out what you and your partner like. You connect your apps and then separately swipe yes or no on questions about whether you;d like ;having your partner drip candle wax on you; or ;your partner dressing as a strict cop.; If you and they match, the app tells you both so you can try it out.Overall, Lover;s content is a lot higher quality and more compassionate than where most people learn about sex: pornography. Having a real sexual medicine doctor overseeing the app lends credibility to Lover. And the design and tone throughout make you feel empowered rather than sleazy.Still, Dr. Blair admits that ;it’s hard to motivate people into behavioral change, people already have subscription apps on their phones and we may run into ;subscription fatigue.; ; People might feel natural paying for Viagra because the impact is obvious. The value of a subscription to sex tips might seem too vague or redundant to what;s free online.To get a lot of users opening their wallets, not just their pants, Lover will need to do a better job of previewing what;s behind the paywall, and offering more interactivity that online content lacks. But if it can give users one unforgettable night thanks to its advice, it may be able to seduce them for the long-run.",https://tcrn.ch/2u2pcz2
1946681,2020-02-14T11:45:30,General Catalyst leads $6 million investment in team productivity startup Range,"In case you haven;t heard, VCs are loving on workplace software as of late, and productivity tools that help teams collaborate seem to be a particular frothy area of investment. A smattering of top VC firms and angels, including General Catalyst,  First Round Capital, Bloomberg Beta, Biz Stone and Ellen Pao, are throwing their confidence behind a new productivity startup called Range.The tool is focused around helping small teams collaborate, grow closer and track their work together. There are quite a few startups with this exact pitch, Range;s key advantage seem to sit with their founding team, which is helmed by Medium;s former head of engineering Dan Pupius, Jennifer Dennard (people ops at Medium) and Braden Kowitz, who was a design partner at GV. The company has used their network to build out an early network of customers, including teams at Twitter, Carta and Mozilla, as well as a network of VCs that are bankrolling their efforts.The SF-based team tells me they have locked down $6 million in seed funding led by General Catalyst as they look to expand their customer base. I chatted with the very nice team of co-founders over a Zoom call and got to see how they used the product internally.;I left Google to join Medium with [Ev Williams and Biz Stone], and we were experimenting with a bunch of different organizational practices, really trying to answer the question of why do companies get worse as they get bigger and could we deploy different management practices at Medium in order to prevent that issue,; Pupius told TechCrunch. ;Through that journey we started building internal tools and we kind of saw this opportunity for software to intentionally encode a lot of the organizational processes or values, and then towards the end of my tenure at Medium, I reconnected with Braden and Jen and we just essentially decided to tackle the problem together.;The core of the product is a bit of a replacement to stand-ups, prompting each user to note what they;re working on every morning, which they can tag to existing larger projects and which is then all interconnected and viewable by members of the specific Range team. The need for a product like this really highlights one of Slack;s big limitations, where even with threads, there really isn;t a great way for communications to be organized in a digestible manner. Every update in Slack drives a conversation that pushes salient info further up the history into obscurity, something that can especially harm remote teams.Beyond check-ins, Range is also helping teams keep track of their objectives and meetings as well as team directories. The product has integration support with Google Docs, Google Calendar, Slack, Asana, Jira, GitHub, Trello, Quip, Figma and others to ensure that information isn;t getting further siloed by adding a new piece of productivity software to the mix. The product has a startup-friendly pricing structure; it;s free for teams under 10 and each additional member costs $14 per month. Pricing obviously gets a bit more customized when it comes to larger customers.Range will likely draw some comparisons with Notion from an organization standpoint, though it also feels much more smoother as a result of being less open-ended. One of the more unique aspects of the product is that the top of the home screen isn;t centered on OKRs or analytics, rather it asks team members a new question every day meant to foster further bonding, and asks them to describe how they;re feeling with an emoji. It;s kind of silly, but the team hopes that short bursts of introspection can push teams closer together in subtle ways that collaboration software doesn;t usually enable.;We found that people are doing really cool things but they;re not talking to each other about it,; Dennard told TechCrunch. ;And so one of the advantages we have as a company is that we can actually help create that community for people.;",https://tcrn.ch/2tX4Qag
1942441,2020-02-14T10:52:57,Married co-founders are a startup;s secret weapon,"“If I was running Clearbanc by myself, it probably would have gone off the cliff eight times at this point,” says Clearbanc co-founder Andrew D;Souza. “If I were running the company by myself, it would be half its size,” adds Michele Romanow, Clearbanc;s other co-founder. In addition to starting the $420 million-backed fintech company together, D’Souza and Romanow are in a relationship.The two initially met at an event in San Francisco, and followed up with a friendly informational interview at a Mexican restaurant. D’Souza;s fundraising experience was a draw for Romanow, who at the time was looking for information about how to raise cash for her startup. Romanow ended up selling her company to Groupon, but her conversation with D’Souza helped to anchor the valuation. It was also the beginning of a relationship. When they started dating in 2014, they swapped war stories about company building. Their connection hinged on this initial commonality ; D’Souza had fundraised all his businesses, whereas Romanow had bootstrapped. It was from these conversations that they created Clearbanc, the Canada-based VC firm that specializes in non-dilutive revenue share agreements for startups.Startups with coupled co-founders at the helm are scoring big funding rounds and exiting companies. Julia and Kevin Hartz co-founded Eventbrite,  which went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2018. Married couple Diane Greene and Mendel Rosenblum were on the co-founding team of VMware, which sold to Dell in 2015. The bond of a relationship may be a secret weapon in company building for new-wave tech startups, but that doesn;t come without risks, like co-founder disharmony, equity supermajority and even divorce.Clearbanc  founders Andrew D;Souza and Michele Romanow;Just put the phone down.;Talk to anyone with a co-founder title at a startup and you;ll find one trend: free time is nearly nonexistent. Couples running a business together say it;s advantageous to be on the same workday cycle. “When you’re working on the same business, you’re on the same cadence of when things are blowing up,; says Romanow. ;So I know exactly why Andrew is on his phone. I know that if he doesn;t do this, I will have to do it.” NEXT Trucking co-founders Lidia Yan and Elton Chung have raised $125 million total for their logistics startup, including a $97 million Series C from Brookfield and Sequoia. The pair says that the company is a presence that’s fully built into their lives and their relationship at all times. While that may be great for a business, it;s not always great for their marriage. “We got into a momentum of talking about work all the time. Not only at the office but at home,” says Yan. The solution is a simple rule enforced by an iPhone alarm. All work-related talk must cease after 8pm every day after the alarm goes off. They also use free time on the weekends to go to restaurants in LA, one of their shared passions. NEXT Trucking co-founders Lidia Yan and Elton ChungCo-founder couples say that if you’re scaling a company, you’ll have to be okay with putting other life decisions on hold, like going on your honeymoon or having kids. Leslie Voorhees and Calley Means were married in 2016, but still haven’t taken their honeymoon. They co-founded Anomalie, a wedding dress customization startup that has raised $18.1 million. Instead of vacationing to Bora Bora the day after their wedding, the newlywed founders hopped on a plane to China, where Leslie stayed for a couple of months to set up the supply chain for Anomalie. The couple admits that even now, they don’t make time for their personal lives.“We have not spent more than an hour of our entire marriage not talking about wedding dresses. It’s not necessarily the healthiest thing, but we’ve enjoyed obsessing about wedding dresses every day,” says Leslie. Their skills complement each other: Calley’s superpower is that he can move fast, whereas Leslie is more methodical and good at setting up structure. While they say that being a co-founder couple has strengthened their bond, they’re working on setting boundaries. Being a founder means you have to sacrifice other areas of your life for the company. ;Once we raise the Series D, we’ll start thinking about having kids,” jokes Calley ; in what may not actually be a joke. Leslie Voorhees and Calley Means, Anomalie co-foundersInvestors are warming up to married co-foundersClearbanc wants to make it easier and faster for startups to raise growth capital. Their 20-minute term sheet product is meant to help founders raise money in 20 minutes, rather than the traditional 3 to 6 months the process typically takes. But how did investors react to Clearbanc;s co-founders relationship status? Not well, at first. A Clearbanc investor passed on an early round, explaining to D;Souza and Romanow that they would have backed either of them individually, but that they were worried about backing them as a couple, especially since they had only been dating for a year at that point. “The same investor ended up coming in two rounds later at 100 times the valuation,” says D’Souza. This, they felt, proved that fear of investing in a couple was a false sense of increased risk.It seems investors today agree. When the married co-founders of Apli, a Mexico-based on-demand recruiting platform, walked into the office of ALLVP, the fund wasn;t entirely sure about what it meant to invest in a company run by a married couple.Founders Vera and Jose met while studying together at Harvard Business School before working at two separate Rocket Internet companies in Mexico and foundling Apli. The business model, product market fit and potential impact for the company were typical factors the fund mulled over before writing a check, but ALLVP also considered the founders; married status. “After some discussion, we decided to analyze the team as any other founding team,” says ALLVP partner Federico Antoni. Besides the obvious personal chemistry, there was a professional chemistry between Vera and Jose. “We weighed the risk of divorce and decided to take it. We gained a team fully invested in the company and one that could balance personal life and startup life.” Equity could pose another risk factor. Investors could be wary of founder couples depending on the equity structure. If their finances are combined, a co-founder couple could own a supermajority of a startup. Say two non-married founders owned 20% of a company ; a co-founder couple whose finances are tied together would own 40%. Given this logic, VCs would inherently have more negotiating power if the founders aren;t financially linked.VCs I talked to didn;t necessarily agree with that logic, though. “The only thing with equity that matters to me is if the founders have enough,; says Andreessen Horowitz General Partner David Ulevitch. ;Venture capital investments are inherently minority investments, so it’s really just about ensuring founders are motivated and rewarded for building something enduring.” But what happens when the dual identities of co-founder and spouse don;t work?Divorce won;t necessarily be the demise of a startupSara and Josh Margulis founded Honeyfund, a honeymoon registry site, in 2006. The then-married couple appeared on Shark Tank in 2015, winning a $400,000 investment from Kevin O’Leary. Sara says that Honeyfund is different from popular wedding startups like Zola and The Knot in that the core product is a crowdfunding platform enabling newly engaged couples to organize wedding and honeymoon financing. When Sara and Josh divorced in 2019, the first instinct was to sell the company. However, “the more we pulled apart professionally, the more opportunities I saw to organize the team the way I wanted to and push the priorities that I wanted,” Sara says. Ultimately, Sara decided she would buy her ex-husband out of the company and continue on a new trajectory as CEO. Honeyfund co-founder and CEO Sara Margulis“If we hadn;t been working together, our separation process would have been different. There were truths that needed to be spoken that were emotionally difficult in a marriage, that I didn’t want to put on Josh in the middle of a big Target partnership launch.”The genesis of their business was rooted in their own experience as a married couple. They’d won the affection of Sharks, operating in a $72 billion industry hinging on the commoditization of love and lasting marriage. But the honeymoon phase can;t last forever. Up to 50% of married couples in the United States will split, according to the American Psychological Association.  Now, Margulis; experience of divorcing her co-founder is informing new products and a marketing strategy as she continues to iterate on her startup. Post-divorce, Margulis has been working on a content-focused strategy at Honeyfund that will include a book and a podcast centered around the idea of how couples can successfully navigate marriages. She;s sourcing 14 years; worth of Honeyfund couples to be interviewed, along with research from psychologists and marriage experts to help couples avoid the doom she went through. The secret weaponCo-founder couples are the first to eagerly point out an obvious advantage. Aligned passions, equal motivation, complementary skillsets and industry experience are a baseline for any co-founder relationship, married or non-married. But being married to your co-founder includes unique challenges like time management and setting boundaries in the boardroom and in the bedroom.;Co-founder disputes are the number one early startup killer, but it doesn;t have to be that way,; writes Garry Tan, managing partner at Initialized Capital and former Y Combinator partner. Co-founders aren’t always aligned on big decisions at the company. Is remote work allowed? Who do we accept funding from and how do we deploy capital? Who do we hire for a key executive role? There are plenty of things to fight about when the stakes are high and your employees; careers are at risk. And co-founder disharmony has been a key reason many startups flounder. But being proactive about conflict management rather than avoiding it is key ; as is knowing when to get professional help from an executive coach or a therapist. This could help early-stage companies recalibrate and dodge turmoil. If this line of reasoning holds, co-founder couples may be at an advantage because they already have built-in communication tools in their relationship.Ulevitch says that for him, couples as co-founders is not a turn off. ;Lots of co-founding teams fall apart, and it’s often to not really knowing each other very well, especially when the going gets tough. Couples actually solve for that aspect nicely.” Founders certainly back up this assertion. “One of the company values is to disagree and commit,” says NEXT Trucking;s Lidia Yan. In what she describes as a rare occasion when executives are not aligned on a decision, she says that a vote will take place, and then the team will all commit to the final decision. In order to mitigate risk, founders say it;s key to have well-defined job descriptions. Stay in your zone, and because you are partners, you should already trust each other with what each person is specialized at. Being married to your co-founder is a secret weapon, according to Helena Price Hambrecht and Woody Hambrecht.Haus co-founders Helena Price Hambrecht and Woody HambrechtHelena and Woody met during the pre-swipe era on OkCupid in 2012. “I had just joined the online dating space and saw this hot farmer dude. We were a 96% match, so I messaged him,” says Helena of how she first connected with her future husband. “I literally thought someone was catfishing me,” thought Woody upon reading Helena’s message. “There’s no way this person is writing me. It took me three or four times to write her back because I wasn’t sure if she was a real person.” After some back and forth, the two met at a dive bar in the San Francisco Richmond neighborhood on a date that culminated in drinking 40s and watching rap videos on their phones in the park. “It’s kind of hard to explain, but it was just so easy. We knew we were going to know each other for the rest of our lives. Maybe as friends, maybe more, we didn’t know.” They stayed friends for four years, and were married in 2018. Haus’ genesis was a combination of the founders; backgrounds, and the direct-to-consumer aperitif brand just scored a $4.5 million seed round. Woody owned a wine and aperitif brand but felt that he wasn;t making a big enough impact. Helena, a Silicon Valley branding and production veteran, felt that Gen Z didn;t want to get drunk anymore, and millennials are tired of compulsory, expensive happy hours. In deciding where to put their money, younger consumers are thinking about their bodies, brand image, transparency, sustainability and authenticity.Helena wondered why the same standards aren;t being applied to as big of an industry as liquor. Why was there not a Glossier or Everlane of alcohol? She felt that while there’s a massive opportunity with all these shifting consumer trends, no one can make a direct-to-consumer alcohol brand. Haus was born from what the founders say was a magic “techie married a wine maker” moment. Woody knew about a legal loophole that could allow the couple to build the Glossier of alcohol. ;There’s this tiny sliver in the aperitif realm, where if a beverage is made of mostly grapes and is under 24% alcohol, it can be classed as a wine and sold DTC,; explains Helena. They had that idea when they had a three-month-old baby. “We do not have time to do this but we have to do it because it’s the best idea we’ll ever have in our life,” she says. “We have a tool kit. We are married. If we have a disagreement about something, we are going to work it out because we’re married. Our skillsets are so clearly defined so there’s not much friction. For us it;s this cool balance where we have two totally separate camps of expertise,; remarks Helena. Woody and Helena have another secret weapon. They work with a business coach who has a background in psychotherapy, and believe that all co-founders should go to therapy together, because it;s always deeper than just business. Talkspace  founders Roni and Oren FrankTalkspace;s Roni and Oren Frank would agree. Their journey to the mental health world started from a crisis within their own relationship. “Our marriage was falling apart, and we eventually decided to give it a last chance in couples therapy.” It was the first time either of them had experienced therapy. It taught them how to communicate better, read each other and support each other better. It gave them tools to manage conflict. Therapy inspired Roni to leave her career as a software developer and go back to graduate school to study psychology. While studying, she says she was exposed to how broken the mental health system in America is. Roni says that research showed 25% of Americans suffer from mental health complications, yet an entire two-thirds of that bucket has no access to mental health care. The two founders both felt passionate about fixing this problem based on how instrumental therapy was in rescuing their own marriage. They decided to launch a platform that lets patients and therapists communicate online. Talkspace, which wants to open access to mental healthcare, has now raised $110 million, most recently a $50 million Series D. The product ideation for the company was integral to the relationship, and the company now has more than 100 employees. But when Talkspace was a young, 10-person startup, it was a lot harder. Roni notes that the co-founder relationship provoked extreme anxiety. “I didn;t sleep well, I didn;t eat well and I experienced burnout.” She says she had to force herself to place boundaries when it comes to being consumed with work. However, overall, her experience has been that sharing a mission and a goal empowers the marriage, a healthy inverse.Co-founder couples rave about the experience of running a business with their spouse. It;s no doubt these companies are developing proprietary products, running winning marketing strategies and generating big rounds and exits.The married co-founder dynamic appears to be great for business, but time will tell if it works as equally well for marriages.",https://tcrn.ch/37qXs4H
1946581,2020-02-14T10:17:32,6 strategic stages of seed fundraising in 2020,"Seed fundraising is rarely easy, but it certainly used to be a lot less complicated than it is today. In a simpler world, a seed investor (or maybe two) would lead a round, which meant that they would write the terms of the deal in a term sheet and then pass that document to their friends to flesh out the funds and eventually close the round. That universe of investors was small and (unfortunately) often cliquish, but everyone sort of knew each other and founders always knew at least who to start with in these early fundraises.That world is long since gone, particularly at the seed stage. Now there are thousands of people who write checks into the earliest startup venture rounds, making it increasingly challenging for founders to find the right investors. “Pre-seed,” “seed,” “post-seed,” “seed extension,” “pre-Series A” and more terms get batted about, none of which are all that specific about what kinds of startups these investors actually invest in.Worse, obvious metrics in the past that helped stack-rank investors — like size of potential check — have come to matter far less. In their place are more nuanced metrics like the ability to accelerate a deal to its closing. Today, your greatest lead investor may be the one who ends up writing the smallest check.Given how much the landscape has changed, I wanted to do two things for founders thinking through a seed fundraise. First, I want to talk about how to strategize around a seed fundraise today, given the radical changes in the market over the past few years. Second, I want to talk about a couple of the archetypes of startup stages you see in the market today and discuss how to handle each of them.This article focuses on “conventional” seed fundraising and doesn’t get into a bunch of alternative models of VC that I intend to explore in the coming weeks. If you thought traditional seed investing is complicated, wait until you see what the alternatives look like. The upshot, though, is that founders with the right strategy have more choices than ever, and, ultimately, that means there are more efficient ways to use capital to get the desired outcome for your startup.Thinking through a seed fundraise strategyLet’s get some preliminaries out of the way. This discussion assumes that you are a startup, looking to fundraise a seed round of some kind (i.e. you’re not looking to bootstrap your company) and that you are looking to close some sort of conventional venture capital round (i.e. not debt, but equity).The problem with most seed fundraising advice is that it isn’t tailored to the specific stage of the startup under discussion. As I see it, there are now roughly six stages for startups before they reach scale. Those stages are:",https://tcrn.ch/39xlCvR
1946566,2020-02-14T09:55:23,Why startups are raising more venture debt as VC dollars near all-time records,"Hello and welcome back to our regular morning look at private companies, public markets and the gray space in between.As I write to you, SaaS and cloud stocks are busy setting fresh all-time highs and as we;ve seen, venture interest in modern software companies is pushing more money into the sector. But despite it appearing to be an incredibly good time to raise equity funding, venture debt and revenue-based financing appear to be having a moment.So why are more folks talking about and raising debt to help power their startups, even when valuations are high and there is a lot of venture capital to be raised?As with all explorations of complex, evolving trends, there;s no one answer. But, some data from a 2019-era survey on venture debt and a conversation I had with equity-free SaaS finance shop Element Finance;s John Gallagher (Element is a Scaleworks spinout) help explain what;s going on. Let;s start with how big the venture debt world is and how fast it is growing and then turn to what;s powering its expansion.Rising debtThe data we;re going to discuss is directional and probably pretty accurate, which is just fine for what we want to do today: detail a general trend of rising venture debt volume over the past few years to confirm what we;ve presumed to be a trend for some time.Thanks to a report from last year undertaken by Kruze (a startup accounting and HR consultancy), what the firm described as the ;largest survey of the venture debt market; undertaken, including firms that ;control well over half of the venture debt dollars in the United States,; here are estimated totals of domestic venture debt volumes for the past half-decade:",https://tcrn.ch/2HmYvIa

Jen Horonjeff, founder and CEO of healthcare startup Savvy, knows this first hand and is trying to change that by applying a cooperative model to her business.As an infant, Horonjeff was diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Since then, she has been diagnosed with a number of autoimmune conditions. Seven years ago this month, she had a brain tumor removed.;I;ve just always been somebody who;s been a patient,; Horonjeff tells TechCrunch.Horonjeff;s experience in the health system led her to become a human factors engineer focused on human-centered design, she says. In that area, work centers on trying to fit the world to people with different abilities, rather than the other way around. From there, Horonjeff, who has her doctorate in environmental medicine, has been most interested in patient-centered outcomes.;So what matters to patients and what affects their health and health behaviors outside of just the traditional things [are what] we;ve been looking at,; she says. ;It was being on that side of the professional equation that I heard my colleagues and partners talking about wanting to help patients, but they were never talking with them. And what they were talking about were not the same priorities as the patient communities that I was part of. And because I;m very open about my condition, they kept coming to me to ask me to be that sole patient representative. When they kept coming back to me, that was really a signal of a diversity issue, since I am white with a Ph.D. in New York City.;Horonjeff;s discomfort with the lack of diversity led her to become a matchmaker between healthcare innovators and patient communities.

As it turned out, he was about as correct as guest as possible as not only did the topics of the week line up with where he invests, he;s also friends with some of the folks that we discussed on the show.So what did we talk about? A whole host of things including two rounds:Headspace;s fascinating $93 million hybrid, debt-and-equity round that pushes its known capital raised to date ahead of arch-rival Calm;s own.Nova Credit;s $50 million round to help power its cross-border credit system. (We all thought this one was smart.Then we turned to two new funds, including Battery;s battery of new capital vehicles that add up to $2 billion.

On the other end of the capital spectrum, Equal Ventures put together its first fund, and we riffed on the health of the micro-fund ecosystem.The news run continued, with our trio touching on Airbnb;s recent financial results, and our wonderment about how to price the firm, the closure of Brandless (RIP), and the issues at SoftBank.All that and we had to leave Lyft;s fascinating earnings and Uber;s profit promises alone as we ran a bit long with just that set of topics.

One of the most common areas of attention respondents highlighted were startups focused on construction and manufacturing. In 2019 alone, the robotics space saw roughly 600 venture-backed fundraising rounds, while construction companies successfully raised roughly 200 venture rounds.With our 2020 Robotics + AI sessions event on the horizon in early March, we;re diving back into the sector to learn about the attributes of construction attracting robotics VCs the most and which types of startups VCs are actually writing checks for in 2020.

1943857,2020-02-14T02:58:06,Silja Litvin of eQuoo says founders should prioritize their mental health,"Entrepreneurs — particularly tech entrepreneurs — face the uphill struggle of building something new in the world. Sometimes that struggle can exact a heavy mental toll. As much as everyone knows they should be sleeping, exercising and meditating, it;s hard to keep all that up when you are trying to build a company.As an entrepreneur whose startup is literally about maintaining good mental health, Silja Litvin  is well aware of the pitfalls. And more so because she’s also a trained family therapist.She attained her master;s in Clinical Psychology and Systemic Family Therapy in 2013 from Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU) in Munich and became a Systemic Family Therapist. In 2015, she began her PhD in Clinical Psychology at LMU with the help of Oxford University College.Born in Germany but living around the world, including California, Litvin encountered many countries and cultures as a professional model, along the way developing an interest in the human condition. This inspired her to go on to look at mental health issues as an entrepreneur.Her mental health startup eQuoo recently became the only game in the U.K.’s National Health Service App Library and is set to shortly close its seed funding round. More recently, she’s been speaking to tech accelerators, most notably Techstars Berlin, about staying mentally healthy in tech startups.EQuoo is an emotional fitness game that aims to teach healthy psychological skills. A U.K. doctor can formally refer eQuoo to their patients to improve their mental health and well-being. The startup has gained scientific backing for its app, going through a “three-arm,” five-week, randomized control trial with more than 350 participants with Bosch  U.K. Indeed, eQuoo has also now achieved a top rating at leading health app assessment platform ORCHA and counts Barmer, Germany;s largest insurance company, among its clients.TechCrunch: Everyone is familiar with normal work stress. What is different about being a tech entrepreneur in relation to the issue of mental health?Silja Litvin: I think as an entrepreneur you completely identify with your job with your company; it;s very closely linked to your self-worth and how you value yourself. And so, if you fail in a normal job environment it’s just you being human, but if you fail as a startup it feels like you aren;t being the best you could be and I think that really puts a completely different pressure on people. And then you have the problem ; as well as being a startup founder ; that you are kind of the ;lead horse,; you;re pulling the cart, and you have to have this appearance of strength towards your employees else they or your investors might freak out. And if you show any weakness, then, you know, it;ll all start to crumble. That’s the difference.",https://tcrn.ch/2SrfWxG

(The most recent round, Series B, was of $8 million in size.)“Despite e-commerce players bandying out major discounts, most of the sales in India are still happening in brick-and-mortar stores. There is a simple reason for that: Trust,” explained Amit Bagaria, co-founder of Simsim, in an interview with TechCrunch.The vast majority of Indians are still not comfortable with reading descriptions ; and that too in English, he said.Simsim is taking a different approach to tackle this opportunity. On its app, users watch short-videos produced in local languages by influencers who apply beauty products or try out dresses and explain the ins-and-outs of the products. Below the video, the items appear as they are being discussed and users can tap on them to proceed with the purchase.;Videos help in educating users about the category. So many of them may not have used face masks, for instance. But it becomes easier when the community influencer is able to show them how to apply it,; said Rohan Malhotra, managing partner at Good Capital, in an interview with TechCrunch.Influencers typically sell a range of items and users can follow them to browse through the past catalog and stay on top of future sales, said Bagaria, who previously worked at the e-commerce venture of financial services firm Paytm .;This interactiveness is enabling Simsim to mimic the offline stores experience,; said Malhotra, who is one of the earliest investors in Meesho,  also a social commerce startup that last year received backing from Facebook and Prosus Ventures.;The beauty to me of social commerce is that you;re not changing consumer behavior. People are used to consuming on WhatsApp  ; and it;s working for Meesho. Over here, you are getting the touch and feel experience and are able to mentally picture the items much clearer,; he said.Simsim handles the inventories, which it sources from manufacturers and brands, and it works with a number of logistics players to deliver the products.;Several Indian cities and towns are some of the biggest production hubs of various high-quality items. But these people have not been able to efficiently sell online or grow their network in the offline world. On Simsim, they are able to work with influencers and market their products,; said Bagaria.The platform today works with more than 1,200 influencers, who get a commission for each item they sell, said Bagaria, who plans to grow this figure to 100,000 in the coming years.Even as Simsim, which has been open to users for six months, is still in its nascent stage, it is beginning to show some growth. It has amassed over a million users, most of whom live in small cities and towns, and it is selling thousands of items each day, said Bagaria.He said the platform, which currently supports Hindi, Tamil, Bengali and English, will add more than a dozen additional languages by the end of the year. In about a month, Simsim also plans to start showing live videos, where influencers will be able to answer queries from users.A handful of startups have emerged in India in recent years that are attempting to rethink the e-commerce market in the nation. Amazon  and Walmart,  both of which have poured billions of dollars in India, have taken a notice too. Both of them have added support for Hindi in the last two years and have made several more tweaks to their platforms to expand their reach.",https://tcrn.ch/38mcHNA

The company had introduced a line of snack bars to complement its line of powders and drinks, while updating its drink line with a nootropic beverage containing caffeine and supplements supposedly designed to boost cognitive performance in addition to providing a meal replacement.Soylent also set up fancy digs in Los Angeles; arts district and established a Food Innovation Lab, which only a year ago awarded $25,000 to a few food startups working there.Now, only a year later, the Food Innovation Lab is shuttered and Soylent has moved to a smaller office space. The company declined to comment on the news or its new strategy.In some ways, Soylent may suffer from being a progenitor of an investment thesis which has passed it by. When the company launched in 2013, it was a fairly novel idea to start a new food brand, as Rhinehart notes in the blog post announcing the executive change:Soylent started as a movement. In 2013, there was scarcely any innovation or attention to one of the world;s most important product sectors: our food. Today, innovative food companies are performing record-breaking IPOs, new retailers are raising massive growth rounds, and food, agriculture, and ingredient technologies are some of the most disruptive startups in the ecosystem. But we still have a lot of work to do to fulfill Soylent’s mission of nutrition for all.Today we are making some changes at the company. We are renewing our commitment to being transparent, authentic and science-driven, all while putting the customer first. To do this we are going to re-focus on our core products. We will be improving our current product line as well as bringing some truly innovative ideas off the shelf and into the market, and we will be improving our prices by focusing on quality over quantity when it comes to distribution and marketing.",https://tcrn.ch/37sL6ci

Unlike some other channels, they;ve tried to inject the ad analytics of the web into the process so that buyers understand what they;re paying for impressions and can point brands to higher ROI locations where they might not have been looking.;You know while the digital market is just so overbid and essentially controlled by Facebook and Google, the returns on investment from out of home ads keeps going up because people out in public have to see and experience them,; Initialized;s Alexis Ohanian,  who led the deal, tells TechCrunch.In recent months, startups like ZeroDown and Brex have coated San Francisco in outdoor advertising campaigns, while the explosion of direct-to-consumer brands has led startups with massive online ad spends to begin looking at the prices of a billboard on the 101. It;s not just ad real estate in SF or New York or LA that;s seeing increased demand; CEO Matt O;Connor tells TechCrunch that the OOH ad market is seeing big growth across the board.;It;s the only non-online channel growing, and it;s actually growing faster in the last year than it has in the past decade,; O;Connor says. ;A big tailwind is that brands are looking to spend offline earlier than they ever have in their history because it;s gotten so expensive that they;re forced to look for channels with better payback.;The key opportunity AdQuick is tapping into is the 30-35% of OOH ad space they estimate went unused in the Unites States last year.Taking on digital ad space sold by Google and Facebook means leveling the playing field, and part of determining that real-world ad;s ROI can mean relying on the same creepy ad analytics services that connect web habits and location data of de-identified devices for serving online ads ; but such are the ills of the advertising world in 2020. These processes allow ad buyers to gain a better idea of what their investment in bench advertising in Cheyenne, Wyo. is actually going to mean in terms of impressions and how much they are paying per pair of eyeballs.One thing AdQuick isn;t interested in is trying to find an entry point to the the non-OOH digital ad market. ;That;s pretty bloody water that;s been picked over by both the duopoly and the thousands of other quote-unquote adtech companies,; O;Connor says.",https://tcrn.ch/2Srayea
1946018,2020-02-13T07:37:30,Datometry snares $17M Series B to help move data and applications to the cloud,"Moving data to the cloud from an on-prem data warehouse like Teradata is a hard problem to solve, especially if you;ve built custom applications that are based on that data. Datometry, a San Francisco startup, has developed a solution to solve that issue, and today it announced a $17 million Series B investment.WRVI Capital led the round with participation from existing investors including Amarjit Gill, Dell Technologies Capital, Redline Capital and Acorn Pacific. The company has raised a total of $28 million, according to Crunchbase data.The startup is helping move data and applications ; lock, stock and barrel ; to the cloud. For starters, it;s focusing on Teradata data warehouses and applications built on top of that because it;s a popular enterprise offering, says Mike Waas CEO and co-founder at the company.;Pretty much all major enterprises are struggling right now with getting their data into the cloud. At Datometry,  we built a software platform that lets them take their existing applications and move them over to new cloud technology as is, and operate with cloud databases without having to change any SQL or APIs,; Waas told TechCrunch.Today, without Datometry, customers would have to hire expensive systems integrators and take months or years rewriting their applications, but Datometry says it has found a way to move the applications to the cloud, reducing the time to migrate from years to weeks or months, by using virtualization.The company starts by building a new schema for the cloud platform. It supports all the major players including Amazon, Microsoft and Google. It then runs the applications through a virtual database running the schema and connects the old application with a cloud data warehouse like Amazon Redshift.Waas sees virtualization as the key here as it enables his customers to run the applications just as they always have on prem, but in a more modern context. ;Personally I believe that it;s time for virtualization to disrupt the database stack just the way it has disrupted pretty much everything else in the datacenter,; he said.From there, they can start developing more modern applications in the cloud, but he says that his company can get them to the cloud faster and cheaper than was possible before, and without disrupting their operations in any major way.Waas founded the company in 2013 and it took several years to build the solution. This is a hard problem to solve, and he was ahead of the curve in terms of trying to move this type of data. As his solution came online in the last 18 months, it turned out to be good timing as companies were suddenly looking for ways to move data and applications to the cloud.He says he has been able to build a client base of 40 customers with 30 employees because the cloud service providers are helping with sales and walking them into clients, more than they can handle right now as a small startup.The plan moving forward is to use some of the money from this round to build a partner network with systems integrators to help with implementation so that they can concentrate on developing the product and supporting other data repositories in the future.",https://tcrn.ch/2uwL0mJ
1945995,2020-02-13T07:04:26,Rocket startup Gilmour Space gets a $3M grant to develop lighter fuel tanks,"Mass is money when it comes to the rocket launch business, and any small savings you can eke out can add up to big savings. That;s been the driving force behind the growing commercialization of space and the rapid rise of the small satellite industry. Now Australian rocket startup Gilmour Space has received a $3 million grant from the Australian government to help improve rockets in a way that could add significant savings to the launch process.Gilmour has spent the past seven years launching a hybrid rocket powered by 3D-printed fuel in 2016, working with NASA and developing a commercial use mobile launch platform for flexible, fast launch capabilities last year. This new award will be used to fund the development of lightweight rocket fuel tanks that are flight-ready and could save as much as 30 percent of the weight of current designs, while saving up to 25 percent off the cost of launch.The project is a collaboration between Gilmour, the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) and Teakle Composites. It is supported by $12.5 million in total investment. The ;cryotanks; (so-called because they store super-cold fuel) that result will be constructed of carbon fibre, which is set to be wound using a robot designed for the purpose, using ;exotic; filament materials that can stand up to extreme temperatures, radiation and other stresses of space.Gilmour Space and USQ entered into a strategic partnership last year to work together on research and development of fundamental new rocket technologies, and this project, along with its work on hybrid fuels and other areas of investigation, will culminate in a plan to launch Gilmour;s first commercial rocket into orbit sometime in 2022. The goal of the company is to reduce the cost of access to space, and changing the cost dynamics of fundamental components of the rocket system is likely the best way to do that, even if it requires a significant amount of research and funding up front to make that happen.",https://tcrn.ch/2SmMNni
1945983,2020-02-13T06:20:56,Astranis raises $90 million for its next-gen satellite broadband internet service,"YC-backed Astranis has raised $90 million of new combined debt and equity funding in a Series B round led Venrock,  with a sizeable contribution by existing investor (and lead of their 2018 round) Andreessen Horowitz. The funding will be used to help the company launch its first commercial satellites, the bedrock of its future internet service offering, aimed at connecting the massive market of underserved populations around the world.Astranis emerged from stealth in 2018 when it announced $13.5 million in funding led by Andreessen and revealed its plan to offer low-cost, reliable internet using geostationary satellites – a different strategy from the increasingly numerous entrants in the satellite internet race who plan to deploy large constellations of satellites into low Earth orbit that don;t stay at a fixed point relative to a specific location on Earth, but that instead hand off their connection via a kind of relay system through ground stations to offer continued service.The geostationary model that Astranis is embracing is somewhat more similar to the existing way of offering internet connectivity from space, which employs very large communications satellite parked in geostationary orbit fairly far away from Earth. Astranis; novel approach uses small satellites that are 20 times smaller than the traditional variety and weigh in at around 770 lbs compared to over 14,000 lbs for legacy satellites.Astranis has made it possible to use smaller satellites thanks to its proprietary ultra-sideband software-defined radio tech, which can provide more bandwidth on much smaller and less complicated hardware, using digital vs. analog technologies. These not only save a ton of space, but can be built and launched with a turnaround time of just months rather than years for the large, geostationary telecommunications spacecraft of yore.As mentioned, this is a combined debt and equity round, including $40 million of equity funding with participating by Y Combinator  and others in addition to Venrock and Andreessen. The remaining $50 million of debt facility comes from TriplePoint Capital. Astranis will be looking to this year and next as the time to grow its internet service provider partnerships, as well as build out its relationships with governments and the rest of the industry.Astranis signed an agreement with launch provider SpaceX  last year for a ride for their first commercial satellite, with the aim of having that mission take place sometime as early as the fourth quarter of 2020. The company has raised $108 million to date, but it has deep-pocketed competitors eyeing the same opportunity with different technologies, including SpaceX;s Starlink and Amazon;s Kuiper.",https://tcrn.ch/38pVSkW
1945964,2020-02-13T06:03:56,Tozny introduces encrypted identity tool as part of security service platform,"Tozny, a Portland, Oregon startup that wants to help companies more easily incorporate encryption into programs and processes, introduced TozID today. It is an identity and access control tool that can work independently or in conjunction with the company;s other encryption tools.;Basically we have a Security as a Service platform, and it;s designed to help developers and IT departments add defense in depth by [combining] centralized user management with an end-to-end encryption platform,; Tozny  CEO and founder Isaac Potoczny-Jones told TechCrunch.The company is introducing an identity and access solution today with the hope of moving beyond its core developer and government audience to a broader enterprise customer base.Under the hood, TozID uses standards identity constructs like single sign-on, SAML and OpenID, and it can plug into any existing identity framework, but the key here is that it;s encryption-based and uses Zero Knowledge identification. This allows a user (or application) to control information with a password while reducing the risk of sharing data because Tozny does not store passwords or send them over the network.In this tool, the password acts as the encryption key, which enables users or applications to control access to data in a very granular way, only unlocking information for people or applications they want to be able to access that information.As Potoczny-Jones pointed out, this can be as simple as one-to-one communication in an encrypted messaging app, but it can be more complex at the application layer depending on how it;s set up. ;It;s really powerful to have a user make that decision, but that;s not the only use case. There are many different ways to enable who gets access to data, and this tool enforces those kinds of decisions with encryption,; he explained.Regardless of how this is implemented, the user never has to understand encryption or even know that encryption is in play in the application. All they need to do is enter a password as they always have, and then Tozny deals with the complex parts under the hood using standard open source encryption algorithms.The company also has a data privacy tool geared towards developers to build in end-to-end encryption into applications, whether that;s web, mobile, server and so forth. Developers can use the Tozny SDK to add encryption to their applications without a lot of encryption knowledge.The company has been around since 2013 and hasn;t taken any private investment. Instead, it has developed an encryption toolkit for government agencies, including NIST and DARPA, that has acted as a funding mechanism.;This is an open source toolkit on the client side, so that folks can vet it for security ; cryptographers like that ; and on the server side it;s a SaaS-type platform,; he said. The latter is how the company makes money, by selling the service.;Our goal really here is to bring the kind of cybersecurity that we;ve been building for government agencies into the commercial market, so this is really work on our side to try to, you might say, bring it down market as the threat landscape moves up market,; he said.",https://tcrn.ch/37urRPO
1945753,2020-02-13T04:00:31,Intuition Robotics raises $36M for its empathetic digital companion,"Intuition Robotics,  the company best known for its ElliQ robot, a digital home companion for the elderly, today announced that it has raised a $36 million Series B round co-led by SPARX Group and OurCrowd. Toyota AI Ventures, Sompo Holdings, iRobot, Union Tech Ventures, Happiness Capital, Samsung Next, Capital Point and Bloomberg Beta also participated in the round. This brings the total funding for the company, which was founded in 2016, to $58 million.The company, which sees it as its mission to build digital assistants that can create emotional bonds between humans and machines, also disclosed it is working with the Toyota Research Institute to bring its technology to the automaker;s LQ concept. Toyota previously said that it wanted to bring an empathetic AI assistant to the LQ that could create a bond between driver and car. Intuition Robotics;s Q platform helps power this assistant, which Toyota calls ;Yui.;Intuition Robotics CEO and co-founder Dor SkulerIntuition Robotics CEO and co-founder Dor Skuler tells me that the company spent the last two years gathering data through ElliQ. In the process, the company spent more than 10,000 days in the homes of early users to gather data. The youngest of those users were 78 and the oldest 97.On average, users interacted with ElliQ eight times per day and spent about six minutes on those interactions. When ElliQ made proactive suggestions, users accepted those about half the time.;We believe that we have been able to prove that she can create an enduring relationship between humans and machines that actually influences people;s feelings and behaviors,; Skuler told me. ;That she;s able to create empathy and trust and anticipate the needs of the users. And that, to us, is the real vision behind the company.;While Intuition Robotics is most closely identified with ElliQ, that;s only one area the company is focusing on. The other is automotive. In the car, the empathetic AI assistant will adapt to the individual user and, for example, provide personalized suggestions for trying out new features in the car or suggest that you open the window and get some fresh air when it senses you are getting tired. As Skuler stressed, the car is actually a great environment for a digital assistant, as it already has plenty of built-in sensors.;The agent gets the data feed, builds context, looks at the goals and answers three questions: Should I be proactive? Which activity should I promote? And which version to be most effective? And then it controls the outcomes,; Skuler explained. That;s the same process in the car as it would be in ElliQ; indeed, the same code runs in both.In order to allow third-parties to build these interactions, the Intuition team decided that it needed to develop specialized tools and a new language that would help designers ; not programmers ; create the outlines of these interactions for the platform.Unlike ElliQ, though, the assistant in the car doesn;t move, of course. In Toyota;s example, the car uses lights and a small screen to provide additional interactions with the driver. As Skuler also told me, the company is already working with another automotive company to bring its Q platform to more cars; however, he wasn;t ready to disclose this second automotive partner.“Intuition Robotics is creating disruptive technology that will inspire companies to re-imagine how machines might amplify the human experience,; said Jim Adler, founding managing partner at Toyota AI Ventures, who will also join the company’s board of directors.Intuition Robotics; team doubled over the course of the last year and the company now has 85 employees, most of whom are engineers. The company has offices in Israel and San Francisco.Unsurprisingly, the plans for the new funding focus on building out its assistant;s capabilities. ;We;re the only company in the world that can create these context-based, nonlinear personalized interactions that we call a digital companion,; Skuler told me. ;We assume people will start doing similar things. There;s a lot more work to do. [;] A big part of the work is to increase our research activities and increase the tools and the performance of the runtime engine for the agent.; He also told me that the team continues to gather data about ElliQ so it can prove that it improves the quality of life of its users. And in addition to this, the company obviously also will continue to build out its work around cars.;We cracked something nobody;s cracked before,; Skuler said. ;And now we;re on the verge of getting value out of it. And it will be hard work because this is not an app. It;s really hard work but we want to capture that value.;",https://tcrn.ch/39q8sRc
1945908,2020-02-13T02:34:53,India;s Vedantu scores $24M more for its online tutoring service,"Vedantu,  a Bangalore-based startup that operates a learning app aimed at students aged between 12 to 18, has secured an additional $24 million as part of its Series C financing round. With the infusion of cash, Vedantu looks to serve more students and make its brand a household name.The fresh infusion to its Series C, which Vedantu first unveiled in August last year, was led by global VC firm GGV Capital. Some existing investors also participated in the round. The $24 million extension broadens the five-year-old startup;s Series C round to $66 million and its total raise to date to $82 million.Vedantu offers live and interactive courses for students in grades 6 though 12. Students who have enrolled for the interactive sessions are required to answer questions every few minutes by tapping on their smartphone screen or on the desktop. They also can raise their doubts at the end of the session.Some of these sessions are free for students, but a selection of it requires a subscription, Vamsi Krishna, co-founder and CEO of the startup, told TechCrunch in an interview.The app has amassed over 75,000 paying subscribers, a figure that Krishna expects to surpass 100,000 this year. The cost of these subscriptions can vary from Rs 100 ($1.4) for students looking for sessions around a particular topic, to Rs 50,000 ($700) for long-term courses that focus on training students for undergraduate-level courses. More than 25 million users come to Vedantu;s app or website each month to consume free lessons.India has the largest school-age population in the world and households in the nation are willing to invest in their children;s education to advance their lives. About a million students look to pursue undergraduate courses each year, for instance.But the quality of education and its affordability are two major challenges that millions of students, especially those living in smaller cities and towns, have to confront. An offline coaching centre can have as many as 100 students sitting in the room, with most not getting a chance to engage with the teacher. But for some, it also means there aren;t many teachers left to teach them.From right to left: Vamsi Krishna, CEO and co-founder; Anand Prakash, co-founder; and Pulkit Jain, co-founder and head of productIn recent years, a wave of tech startups including Byju;s, which was valued at $8 billion in its most recent fund raise last week, have emerged to tackle these challenges as low-cost Android handsets flood the Indian market and mobile data prices become incredibly affordable.Vedantu allows students to interact with their teachers through the microphone and camera on their smartphone or desktop and also through a chat box on the app. These teachers also have assistants who work with students.Since it;s a virtual class, Vedantu is also able to accommodate more students in a session. A paid session may have as many as 600 students while the free lessons could have 2,000, said Krishna, who is a teacher himself. Until early 2014, he  also ran Lakshya Institute, which helped students prepare for undergraduate-level courses, before selling a majority stake to Mumbai-based K-12 tutoring and test preparation firm MT Educare.Running a tech platform has also enabled Vedantu to offer its subscription service at a more affordable price than a typical offline coaching equivalent that can cost users anything between a few hundred dollars to a few thousand.To ensure that students are paying attention and identify their weaknesses, Vedantu says it has built a patented system called WAVE that evaluates about 70 parameters, including whether the student is looking at the screen. More than 90 percent of its students engage with the session, said Krishna.Hans Tung, Managing Partner at GGV Capital,  who is joining the board of Vedantu as part of the investment, said he thinks Vedantu has reached the inflection point with its WAVE product. WAVE enables teachers to deliver ;superior results as it can offer personalized education to many students at once,; he said. ;We are excited to partner with Vamsi and the Vedantu team and share GGV’s global expertise and network to help them scale and shape learning outcomes for millions of students in India and beyond.”Krishna said the startup has grown phenomenally in recent years, so it is beginning to spend some money to better market its brand. In December, the startup ran some commercials on TV channels. In addition to that, Vedantu has also started to add courses to serve even younger students. The new courses are in pilot stage and would be broadly launched in a few months, he said.",https://tcrn.ch/2Snmb5L
1945646,2020-02-13T00:30:57,Tandem Bank;s chief product officer has joined Santander InnoVentures,"Following the departure of its CTO last month, Tandem Bank, the U.K. challenger bank co-founded by fintech veteran Ricky Knox, has lost another key member of its team: chief product officer Matt Ford, who is departing for a career in venture.Ford joined Santander InnoVentures, the venture capital arm of the Spanish incumbent bank, in December, TechCrunch has learned. He has been recruited for his entrepreneurial and operator experience as Santander InnoVentures looks to bolster its perceived founder-friendliness.Confirming the move, Ford tells TechCrunch: ;Yes, I left Tandem before Christmas. I’ve moved across into venture capital and have taken up a really exciting opportunity at Santander InnoVentures, the VC fund of the bank. We’re building out a really great founder-friendly fund, and it’s a brilliant chance to apply all my entrepreneurial learnings to investing and to help support great fintech founders and teams;.Prior to Santander, Ford held the role of CPO at Tandem, charged with helping strengthen the challenger bank;s various existing and future product lines. He was viewed (and presented to the press) as an important lieutenant to Tandem founder Knox.Noteworthy, Ford joined Tandem by means of an acquisition after the bank acquired Pariti, the money management app, in early 2018. According to LinkedIn, Pariti;s other co-founder, Peter Townsend, remains an employee of Tandem, where he holds the position of Head of Engineering.Meanwhile, Ford;s confirmed departure from Tandem follows a report this week from Sifted that the bank’s Chief Technical Officer Paul Clark also stepped down last month. He;s been replaced by Noam Zeigerson, the challenger bank;s Chief Data Officer.Separately, TechCrunch understands that Santander has hired Trish Burgess as its new global Head of Peer-to-Peer Payments. Trish joins from Apple ; where I gather she was involved with Apple Card ; and will lead the bank;s future P2P payments efforts. Her appointment is expected to be announced soon.",https://tcrn.ch/2uFnWly
1945671,2020-02-12T11:55:32,Peru’s startup scene is ready for more,"										Greg Mitchell						Contributor																Share on Twitter																Greg Mitchell is regional director of Angel Ventures, a startup investor and advisor and is the creator of the blog Ruta Startup.			Funding of Latin American startups has doubled each year over the past two years.And while most of this capital has been directed toward Brazil and Mexico, this surge is starting to have an effect on startups in the region’s smaller markets. The increased availability of capital for later rounds is creating more opportunities for startups to scale both regionally and globally. And while it may not be one of the largest countries in Latin America, Peru continues to have one of the best-performing economies and fastest-growing startup scenes.In 2019, a new record was set for the amount of capital invested into Peruvian startups, at least $11 million, a 24% increase compared to 2018. Most of the money went to fintech (47%) and edtech (37%) startups. Over the past four years, more than $22.7 million in public funds went toward startup-related projects as well.The government-backed program Innóvate Perú awarded approximately $13.8 million of its total investments almost exclusively to startups. Total venture capital investment will likely exceed US$25 million in 2020, doubling what was achieved in 2019, and will continue to grow from there.In 2019, Peru’s development bank, COFIDE, announced a new fund of funds to invest in venture capital firms, mirroring similar entities such as Chile’s CORFO, Colombia’s Bancoldex and Mexico’s NAFIN. While there are plenty of opportunities to secure seed-stage capital in Peru, many startups still have to look abroad for growth capital. Keynua, Xertica, Turismoi and Runa are just a few of the Peruvian startups that sought international investors to lead their rounds over $1 million. Following in the path of similar funds, the fund of funds will invest $20 million in half a dozen venture capital firms, which would in turn invest in approximately 120 startups.As government support for entrepreneurs continues to pour in, the Peruvian startup ecosystem is entering a new phase. More and more startups are launching, graduating from accelerator programs and seeking ways to reach their next milestone. Local early-stage investors are stepping in to fill the financing gap and have teamed up to form the Peruvian Seed and Venture Capital Association, PECAP, to share investment opportunities and lay a strong foundation for venture capital in Peru. Here’s a look at just a few of the opportunities for more venture capital to step in.Fueling Peru’s growing fintech sectorA massive fintech boom is playing out across Latin America, with the size of the industry expected to exceed $150 billion by 2021. Peru is home to an estimated 120 fintech startups actively tackling the issues of financial inclusion and better servicing the region’s small and medium-sized businesses. Peru’s economy is still largely informal, with approximately 14 million people underbanked. In 2017, María Laura Cuya started Peru’s Fintech Association to work alongside regulators, academics and other organizations to improve financial literacy and access to financial products, with a focus on Peruvian SMEs.A few of Peru’s fintech sectors stand out, including factoring and foreign exchange, where a number of startups are quickly gaining traction and already branching out to neighboring markets. Innova Funding, Innova Factoring, Facturedo, Kambista and Rextie are just a few examples. Peru’s membership in the Pacific Alliance also makes it an attractive initial market prior to launching in other Pacific Alliance countries.In 2019, Peruvian fintechs Keynua and Apurata were selected for the Y Combinator accelerator program, putting them on the international radar. Traditional banks in Peru are also shifting their mindsets and warming up to fintech partnerships. The publicly traded Peruvian bank, Credicorp, for example, recently set up a corporate venture fund called Krealo. The bank made its first investments in Culqi, a local payments gateway, and Independencia, a lending platform.Impact investing opportunitiesLatin America is a top destination for impact investment capital, outpacing many other regions in the world, with a 15% compound annual growth rate over the last five years, according to the Global Impact Investing Network. Edtech represents a rising entry point across the region for impact investors thanks to its potential for both financial and non-financial returns.According to an OECD report, approximately 30 million young people in Latin America are not participating in any form of education, training or employment, and 76% of this total are women. Laboratoria, co-founded by edtech thought leader Mariana Costa Checa, helps women develop technical skills and has expanded across the region from its headquarters in Lima to train more than 1,000 women so far. The startup has received praise from global companies, including Walmart and Facebook. In 2019, the skills development platform Crehana raised the largest-ever round for a Peruvian startup ($4.5 million) from both regional and global funds.Peru attracted more impact investment capital than Mexico, a longtime leader in the region, for the first time in 2018. Much of this investment is focused on improving Peru’s education system. Local startups are addressing everything from early childhood education to workforce training, and as more success stories emerge, more resources will be needed to fully tap into Latin America’s large markets for these solutions.Supporting long-term startup growthThe government-backed program Innóvate Perú has financed more than 3,400 entrepreneurial projects to date, and more than 25 private institutions are now accelerating, incubating and investing in Peruvian startups. New startup creation is at its highest rate ever; however, these companies are outgrowing their angel and seed-stage supporters and are now seeking ways to take their ventures to the next level.Over the past few years, Latin America has proven that it is a place where startups can scale and succeed. Now, with more startups coming out of the region’s smaller, underserved markets, like Peru, there is an opportunity to deploy capital effectively and bring impactful solutions to millions of people across the region.*Angel Ventures was an investor in Culqi before it was sold to BCP.

The company has raised north of $70 million from backers including Founders Fund and Khosla Ventures. A great deal of this funding surrounds the idea that there is more untapped potential in the sleep economy than existing players in the space have been able to imagine.While Franceschetti says he intends for his company to remain private for the ;foreseeable future,; Eight Sleep is in a less-than-comfortable spot following Casper;s  botched IPO last week. Though Casper;s stock popped on its first day of trading, the process of pricing its shares ended up leaving its private investors a bit less than ecstatic. Casper debuted trading at a value of $575 million, a far cry from the $1.1 billion private market valuation it had previously achieved.Franceschetti has been aiming to transform Eight Sleep into a company more focused on a robust tech platform than your average bed-in-a-box company. The startup;s initial effort, a smart sleep cover for your existing mattress, evolved into a mattress with a layer of sensors that then transformed into a sensor-laden mattress with a heating and cooling unit, called ;The Pod.; The company;s product development has aimed to build out a more end-to-end platform for sleep, something Franceschetti says has made him reticent to compare his company to other direct-to-consumer mattress companies.",https://tcrn.ch/31LspPW

But it works both ways — margin trading lets you multiply your gains and your losses.Margin trading is going to be available on Coinbase Pro, the company’s exchange interface for educated investors. Both retail and institutional investors will be able to submit margin trading orders with up to 3x leverage. It’ll work with any pair of assets with USD as the base currency.For now, the feature is limited to 23 U.S. states if you’re a retail investor. Institutional investors in 45 states and nine international countries can access margin trading, though.There are many potential use cases for margin trading. For instance, you can allocate a tiny portion of your portfolio to a margin trading order to hedge across multiple positions. Coinbase  believes it has enough liquidity to help investors set up sophisticated margin trading orders.If you’re a retail customer living in one of the 23 states where margin trading is available, you might not be able to use it. The company wants to restrict margin trading to the most advanced traders.Coinbase is going to track your past activity on Coinbase Pro and look at trades, balances, deposits and withdrawals. If you’re an active trader, you’ll be able to access margin trading.Here;s the list of 23 U.S. states with margin trading for retail investors: Florida, Texas, Illinois, New Jersey, Virginia, Georgia, Arkansas, Alaska, Oregon, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas, Maine, South Carolina, Utah, Wisconsin, Wyoming and West Virginia.Disclosure: I own small amounts of various cryptocurrencies.",https://tcrn.ch/2OPrUyT

In fact, Chavez is Habu;s chairman, Vaidya serves as CTO and their former Krux colleague Matt Kilmartin (who eventually became chief customer officer for Salesforce;s consumer engagement platform after Salesforce acquired Krux) is the startup;s CEO.Kilmartin told me that Habu was created to solve a ;still elusive; marketing challenge — delivering ;omni-channel orchestration for the entire customer journey.; In other words, he;s saying that chief marketing officers are still struggling to deliver personalized messages to potential customers across every channel and at every stage.Kilmartin argued that;s because they;re challenged by new privacy regulations, plus the fact that many marketing tools struggle to integrate data from the major digital ad platforms. And then there are the limitations of the big marketing clouds (including Kilmartin;s old employer Salesforce), which he said are ;stitching together all the stuff they bought — their goal is to have everyone go all-in on one of their stacks.;So Habu isn;t trying to build yet another marketing platform. Instead, the company describes its core product as a ;marketing data operating system; that can be used alongside the aforementioned clouds, bringing a company;s customer data together across platforms, then providing automated insights and recommendations on how to use that data to deliver personalized marketing. And it does this in a way that complies with privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.A startup factory? $1.2B-exit team launches $65M super{set};We;re trying not to be a platform,; Kilmartin said. ;It;s a modular, interoperable suite of services.;Habu;s software can pull in a marketer;s first-party customer data, as well as data from platforms like Google and Facebook. Kilmartin said that while these platforms remain a ;blind spot; for many marketers, ;They have APIs and frameworks to be able to do this, it just requires a level of sophistication. And there just aren;t that many extra data scientists that these brands have sitting around.;In addition to super{set}, Habu;s funding comes from Ridge Ventures. And although Habu is only launching publicly today, it already has customers in the CPG and media industries.Update: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified some of Habu;s customers.Adobe announces GA of customer data platform",https://tcrn.ch/2SCc7EV
1945180,2020-02-12T09:06:49,"Understanding Airbnb;s new, stubborn lack of profits","Hello and welcome back to our regular morning look at private companies, public markets and the gray space in between.This morning we;re exploring Airbnb;s march to the public markets. The popular DIY hospitality startup promised last year that it would go public in 2020. That timeline means that its 2019 performance will be included in an eventual S-1 filing, putting the results on public display.Recent news, however, doesn;t paint a perfect picture for the famous unicorn. Indeed, Airbnb;s  history of rapid growth and profitability appears to have been replaced by slowing growth and profit struggles. The Wall Street Journal reported results from the company;s third quarter that are at once encouraging ; a return to profitability ; and troublesome; Airbnb;s first three quarters of 2019 are in the red as a group, a change from historical profitability.If Airbnb goes public soon, as it has promised, its recent, trailing results will matter. To get ready for its IPO, let;s rewind through what we;ve learned about Airbnb;s revenue, revenue growth and profitability over the years. Doing this will help us understand how the startup went from rising profitability to posting, through the first three quarters of 2019, a nine-figure net loss.The Airbnb public offering (likely a direct listing) is going to be the financial event of the year. Get excited.RewindThe following data points were culled from a host of reports over the past half decade. Each is accompanied by its original source, and I encourage you to read the pieces to get a feel for how Airbnb has been discussed through time. The tone of Airbnb coverage largely tracks its performance; when Airbnb was at the steepest part of its growth curve, the media was enthused. Lately, however, the writing is a bit different.You;ll see why:2015: Around $900 million in revenue (24/7 Wall St., implied math)Q3 2015: $340 million in revenue (MarketWatch)2016: Revenue of $1.7 billion, $100 million in adjusted EBITDA (Fortune)",https://tcrn.ch/38mNZfZ
1945501,2020-02-12T08:58:02,ePharmacy Ro launches doc-approved WebMD rival Health Guide,";Whatever your symptom, WebMD says you have cancer.; It;s a long-running joke that underscores the distrust of perhaps the top source of medical advice, stemming from a confusing site clogged with ads that;s been criticized for questionable information and pushing pills from its sponsors.Health Guide is the new medical handbook for the internet, where 30% of content is written by doctors and 100% is reviewed by them. On a single clean, coherent page for each condition, it lays out a tl;dr summary, what the ailment really is, how to spot the symptoms and what you need for treatment. Rather than pushing you to nervously keep clicking, it just wants to answer the question.Health Guide officially launches today. It was built by digital pharmacy Ro, which has raised $176 million for medicine brands Roman for men;s health, Rory  for women;s health and Zero for smoking cessation. With Ro, patients can get a $15 telemedicine consultation with a doctor, receive an instant prescription and have it filled and sent to you from the startup;s in-house pharmacy operating in all 50 states. A competitor to Hims &amp; Hers, Ro scored a $500 million valuation last year.Rather than aggressively hawking its own products at the end of articles, Health Guide just lists the medications you could take, insists you ask a doctor what;s right and leaves it up to you to choose where to buy.  Ro founder Zachariah Reitano calls Health Guide ;a significant investment in trust. There;s not a clear ROI (return on investment) to it but it;s one of those long-term bets . . . Providing education to patients will serve Ro really well in the long-run.; He acknowledges the suspicions of self-dealing, and says ;if we don;t do this correctly, it can hurt more than it can help.;On Health Guide you can search for specific conditions, browse categories like diabetes or hair loss and browse featured articles like ;Proven ways to increase the density of your bones; or ;How do you test for gonorrhea.; There are no banner ads, so your search about the flu or testosterone won;t immediately lead to you being bombarded with promotions for Mucinex or dicey supplements. ;On these other sites . . you have [advertisers] with unregulated supplements and services that are the highest bidder beside medical information, which creates a lot of distrust.;The simplicity and accuracy of Health Guide has already attracted a sizable audience. It;s on pace to reach 30 million readers this year, with 25% being women despite Roman;s initial focus on aiding men with erectile dysfunction. It already ranks in the top 10 Google results for 300 medical questions. The no-filler entries come signed by the specific doctors that wrote or approved them, and Ro pledges to have them reviewed and updated at least once per year. At the bottom are links to all the original source material, including peer-reviewed medical journals.Reitano tells me that the idea from Health Guide came after Ro;s physicians and customer service were bombarded with the same patient questions over and over. The easiest move was to put all the answers on an open site they could send patients to. A major goal was to debunk hoaxes other sites often don;t address directly. ;For something like vaccines where there is a potential for misinformation, you;ll see us take a strong stance. We won;t let the potential for misinformation spread through Health Guide.;One thing Health Guide is missing that could keep people coming back to WebMD  is a symptom checker. Right now it;s better at research on major conditions or lifestyle choices than figuring out why your throat;s sore. But given it;s day one and Ro has tons of funding, it has plenty of time to improve. There;s sure to be concerns about how it collects data and what treatments Health Guide lists. So as a precaution, it never forcefully makes recommendations besides asking a doctor for personalized advice, and there;s just one button atop the site for visiting its medication marketplace.Ro is trying to move fast as the ePharmacy space heats up. It plans to launch 10 more products in the next two quarters, with a focus on Rory for women. It just struck an exclusive deal with Pfizer to provide Roman customers with generic Viagra, offering clear supply chain transparency around a drug that;s often counterfeited. And thanks to its licenses across all states, it;s helping new weight loss treatment Plenity launch nationwide atop its diagnosis, prescription and fulfillment technology.Yet Reitano sees space for multiple startups to succeed in replacing embarrassing and inconvenient in-person trips to the doctor or drug store. ;It might be a somewhat cheesy answer but . . . the best thing about competition is it makes everyone build a better experience for patients,; he says, citing NURX and PillClub enhancing birth control access. ;I think all this innovation in digital health ; it;s an absolutely massive market. No one;s taking market share from someone else. We;re raising the bar for care.;",https://tcrn.ch/2Slacpj
1945522,2020-02-12T08:27:58,Headspace raises $93 million in equity and debt as it pursues clinical validation for mindfulness,"Headspace, the Los Angeles-based mindfulness and meditation company locked in a bitter competitive struggle with Calm for leadership in the mental wellness world, has raised new capital to try to take the pole position.The company has just closed on $93 million in new equity and debt financing from a slew of investors as it pursues a number of clinical studies that could provide scientific validation for the somewhat nebulous claims around the benefits associated with mindfulness and meditation.That clinical validation can also unlock new dollars in the form of government payments for mindfulness therapies that could be used to treat a variety of conditions. It also makes more valid the company;s pitch to companies as a useful component of an employee benefit program.The company touted a pipeline of 70 clinical studies working in conjunction with academic partners, including Carnegie Mellon, University of California San Francisco and Stanford University.Headspace;s  new cash comes from investment firm blisce, with participation from Waverly Capital, Times Bridge (the investment arm of The Times Group of India), The Chernin Group, Spectrum Equity and Advancit Capital. A $40 million debt financing from Pacific Western Bank supplemented the $53 million in equity.“Headspace has shown millions of people the power of using mindfulness to mitigate stress, anxiety, and other everyday issues while continuing to advance the field through clinically-validated research,” said Richard Pierson, the chief executive and co-founder of Headspace, in a statement. “As we think about the next ten years and beyond, we are focused on harnessing this power and applying it to other areas of our members’ lives to help them create healthy routines that last a lifetime ; whether that is through our Headspace consumer app, the work we currently do with hundreds of employers, or with healthcare providers as we look to deliver better access.” So far the company;s app has been loaded more than 62 million times in 190 countries. It already has over 2 million paid subscribers and more than 600 businesses are using Headspace;s on-the-job mental wellness tool.The new money will be used to double down on its pitch to businesses and healthcare practitioners, according to a statement from the company, as well as to look at international markets. The company already has German and French versions of the app and has appointed the Apple executive Renate Nyborg to lead its European expansion.As the new cash comes in, Headspace also has more money to compete for the attention of consumers with Calm, which raised an $88 million round (one that valued the company at over $1 billion) a little over a year ago.Meditation app Calm hits unicorn status with fresh $88 million fundingBacked by TPG Capital and the entertainment agency CAA, Calm has recently inked deals with big time celebrities like LeBron James, who also has an equity stake in the company.Calm;s approach seems to center more on a direct-to-consumer strategy that has seen the company enlist celebrities like James, John McEnroe, Matthew McConaughey’s and the English comedian, actor and writer Stephen Fry.&nbsp;",https://tcrn.ch/3bz7LXC
1945498,2020-02-12T07:19:58,Ramp is a corporate card focused on helping you spend less,"Meet Ramp, a new startup that offers corporate credit cards with 1.5% cash back on everything. The company thinks that a cash-back program combined with an analysis of your payments to help you spend less is more valuable than alternative corporate card offerings.Ramp is launching publicly today and has raised $25 million in funding from Keith Rabois, Coatue, BoxGroup, Conversion Capital, Soma Capital, Backend Capital and more than 50 business angels.The startup doesn’t charge fees. All your employees can have a white Visa card for $0 per month. There are no foreign transaction fees and no interest either. The company plans on making money with interchange fees — like all card issuers, Ramp will get a very very tiny cut on all transactions.One of the main selling points of Ramp is that it offers you control and visibility. You can set different limits for each employee, create as many cards as you want and set up spending rules. The service also helps you centralize receipts and attach them to each expense. There are some integrations with accounting software.Like Brex, Ramp is going to work particularly well with high-growth startups. When you sign up, Ramp doesn’t require personal guarantees. You also get higher spending limits than what you’d get from traditional corporate cards — Ramp says you can expect limits that are 10 to 20 times higher than typical limits.Unlike Brex, Ramp doesn’t have a complicated point-based reward system. You’re not going to earn more points when you order a Lyft or book flights through Brex. Instead, with Ramp, you get 1.5% back on all your purchases — it can be a recurring subscription, an expensive flight, a team lunch… 1.5% on everything.Existing customers include some well-known startup names, such as Ro, Candid, Better, Eight Sleep and Truebill.Ramp goes one step further by analyzing how you spend money. For instance, if you’re paying multiple subscriptions to the same service, Ramp is going to flag that as a duplicate subscription. If you’re spending an unusual amount of money on a specific service, Ramp will recommend a lower subscription tier.The startup also offers free credits for dozens of third-party services, such as Amazon Web Services, Amplitude, Plaid, Datadog, DocSend, Notion, Twilio, Sendgrid, etc. Overall, it represents $175,000 in free credits.Ramp was founded by Eric Glyman and Karim Atiyeh. The team previously founded Paribus, a startup that helps you save money on online purchases that was acquired by CapitalOne.It’s a solid offering overall. There are probably many startups that are looking for a simple corporate card solution with a cash-back program. And the fact that Ramp wants to help you spend less shows that the startup cares more about providing a good user experience over generating quick revenue.",https://tcrn.ch/2tWF5qM
1945429,2020-02-12T07:19:15,"Taking a page from SimCity, UrbanFootprint pitches new tools for urban development","For decades, the best urban planning simulation wasn;t a simulation for urban planners at all, but the wildly popular city building game, SimCity, says Peter Calthorpe, an expert in the field and the co-founder of UrbanFootprint.Calthorpe began his career as an urban planner and designer in the late seventies, and in the mid-eighties he wrote the book on sustainable communities alongside the famous architect and designer, Sim Van der Ryn.Working on design and development projects across Portland, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and (my home state) Southern Louisiana, Calthorpe approached urban design through the lens of climate resilience and sustainability ; all the while developing the suite of tools that would become UrbanFootprint .;Through our practice we started looking at a tool that gathered all the data together [and] organized it in a way that allowed for intelligent queries; [It] allowed people to ask questions and plan scenarios,; Calthorpe said in an interview.That tool became the basis for UrbanFootprint, which is a way to visualize certain developments and use the software to model out the results of what would happen if certain design decisions were made, according to Calthorpe.;Because cities are so complex and so interconnected in all of their dimensions, looking at multiple outcomes simultaneously is the healthiest and the best way to think about possible outcomes,; he says.Ultimately, it;s not that much different than SimCity.Partnering with Calthorpe on the project is Joe DiStefano, who serves as the company;s chief executive and was a longtime colleague from Calthorpe;s work at his eponymous urban planning firm (which was sold last May to the infrastructure development giant HDR).UrbanFootprint actually spun out of Calthorpe as a separate company roughly three years ago and is now looking to expand thanks to an $11.5 million investment from venture capital firms, including previous investor Social Capital and new investors Valo Ventures and Radicle Impact.“Businesses across every major industry are realizing that to succeed in cities, you need to understand them,” said DiStefano, in a statement. “By creating easy access to essential planning data and analyses, UrbanFootprint offers a new solution for anyone focused on cities or urban markets to build more efficiently and sustainably.”The company;s software cleans and curates data sets, including open data from municipal agencies and commercially collected data sets, to create a super-schema of land use across the entire United States, DiStefano says. The software then serves up existing conditions based on queries for any parcel of land anywhere the UrbanFootprint software has data.Above: UrbanFootprint’s data and toolset shows urban infrastructure and its potential risk profile from climate-related and other hazardsCities now house roughly half of the global population, and that number is expected to reach 70% of the world;s men, women and children over the next several decades. ;Just about every major issue we confront; All these things intersect in the way we shape cities and yet there;s no tool that allows people to think coherently about it,; says Calthorpe. ;We;re a platform that allows people to understand the city itself.;That understanding is valuable not just for urban planners and architects, but for corporations ranging from manufacturers to healthcare providers.The American Lung Association is using UrbanFootprint;s tools to understand how urban density and air quality can impact respiratory disease and health broadly, said Calthorpe.That;s just one example. The global strategy and design consultancy Gehl is using UrbanFootprint;s software to analyze the optimal locations for micromobility companies to place bikes and scooters in neighborhoods and how those decisions effect job accessibility and neighborhood amenities.Meanwhile, the much-maligned Northern California utility Pacific Gas and Electric is using UrbanFootprint to see how heat waves affect their infrastructure and distribution network, according to a statement from the company.“PG&amp;E’s Climate Resilience team is working to ensure that PG&amp;E is building a resilient system that will be able to continue to provide safe, affordable, and reliable energy to its customers amidst the growing risks of climate change,” said Heather Rock, Climate Resilience Chief at PG&amp;E. “To that end, we are using forward-looking climate data to better inform how we plan and protect our infrastructure, employees, customers, and communities in which we serve. UrbanFootprint is an important partner to us as we seek data and tools that allow us to assess and mitigate these risks in a thoughtful way.”Investors like Jay Zaveri, a longtime partner at Social Capital see UrbanFootprint as part of a growing number of technology companies working on developing tools for the urban environment.“Cities are superstructures for culture, lifestyles, aspirations, and well-being ; the real ;social networks; in our lives,” said Zaveri, in a statement. ;Since 2018, UrbanFootprint has helped private and civic planners, mobility and energy companies execute nearly 4,000 projects in over 700 cities in the U.S., providing answers for complex scenarios in a matter of hours. This is a phenomenal effort as we move to seven billion urban citizens by 2050, with the urgent need of this decade being resilience and preparedness for urban systems.”",https://tcrn.ch/2Sl8lRh
1945377,2020-02-12T07:05:49,Reset Button is approaching student debt from a new angle,"Student loan debt in the U.S. totals $1.5 trillion, and more than 44 million Americans have outstanding student loan debt.According to research by Villanova law professor Jason Iuliano, a million student loan debtors have filed for bankruptcy in the past five years. However, 99.9% of them did not include their student loan debt in their bankruptcy filing.This research was the seed of what would become Reset Button, a new startup founded by Iuliano and Rob Hunter looking to help student loan debtors who have gone through bankruptcy find a new way to include those debts in their filing.The only way you can include student loan debt in a bankruptcy filing is through litigation. Those cases have been historically less likely to settle out of court than other types of civil cases.This means that the cost of including student loan debt in bankruptcy filings is, at the very least, around $10,000. Now, if there was some guarantee that you could trade hundreds of thousands of dollars of student loan debt for $10,000-$15,000, you;d obviously do it. But most folks who are already in the process of filing for bankruptcy don;t have a spare $10,000 minimum to spend on a litigator. And even if they did, there is no guarantee they;d win in court, resulting in even more debt and no relief.This is what Reset Button  is trying to change.To be clear, Reset Button is targeted directly at folks who have already filed for bankruptcy but were told they couldn;t include their student loan debt in those filings, and so they didn;t.Here;s how it works:Reset Button has built a network of litigation lawyers who have experience in seeking student loan discharges. When a new user fires up Reset Button, the startup sends them through an evaluation process that collects financial information, etc. to assess whether or not one of those lawyers could litigate the discharge of that user;s student loan debt. That evaluation factors in a number of signals, including past legal cases that are comparable to the user;s situation.That process also does a lot of the heavy lifting that makes hiring a litigator so expensive. These lawyers often have to do tons of research, tracking down statements and bills and other paperwork, before they can truly get started with the litigation.Reset Button, as the connective tissue between debtor and lawyer, is able to automate a lot of that process for the lawyers, delivering a package of information on the case and connecting the user with the right lawyer for them.Reset is also looking to bring down the cost for debtors. The company charges either 12% of the total debt discharged, or $10,000 (whichever is lowest). Reset also allows users to pay that sum over time, in $300 monthly installments. This is in stark contrast to people who hire their own lawyer, who would be responsible for the costs upfront.Reset Button is able to do this through a payment process called factoring. In short, Reset buys the receivables from the attorney;s fees, and charges the debtor with their own payment plan. Reset makes money from lawyers who pay for the lead generation, the technology services and the marketing apparatus.Factoring has come under fire from some who say that service providers sometimes raise prices to account for their fee, but Reset Button co-founders Hunter and Iuliano say their lawyers are actually charging less because of the workflow optimization provided by Reset Button.The company also provides a Knowledge Base for debtors seeking financial guidance and resources, but the only revenue stream comes from the actual litigation of student loan debt in bankruptcy filings. Other services like refinancing, debt consolidation or income-based payments are not provided by Reset Button, and the company has no official partnerships with those types of service providers.However, Hunter said that it may be an avenue the company explores as it grows.Perhaps most importantly, Reset Button offers a Fresh Start guarantee. In short, if the lawyer doesn;t manage to get your debt wiped, Reset will pay your legal bills.There has been movement in the landscape of student loan discharges with bankruptcy.Essentially, debtors must prove in court that they pass the test of ;undue hardship,; which is a notably vague framework. Though there is a bit of variability among the various court circuits, the general idea is that a debtor must prove that they can;t currently pay back the loan, that there will not be a change down the line that will allow them to pay the loan in the future and that they have made every effort to pay the loans in the past.Historically, that;s been a difficult threshold to cross for the fraction of people who take steps to litigate their student loan debt. However, in small ways, courts seem to be opening up the interpretation of undue hardship.;There;s a phrase that gets used in these cases that I think perpetuates this myth, and that is to call it a ;certainty of hopelessness;,; said John Rao, attorney with the National Consumer Law Center. ;And it;s almost like, as long as you;re still alive and breathing, something could improve for you. That;s just an impossible burden. It;s basically saying you could win the lottery or something. That;s just not the standard I think Congress had in mind.;In 2015, in a case between Robert E. Murphy and the DOE/ECMC, Rao wrote to the courts arguing that they should reassess the test for undue hardship:Rather than adopt one existing test over another, we urge this Court to provide a formulation of the undue hardship standard in simple terms, that restricts consideration of extraneous and inappropriate factors not consistent with the statutory language. A finding about whether a debtor’s hardship is likely to persist should be based on hard facts, not conjecture and unsubstantiated optimism.More recently, a judge in the Southern District of New York ruled in favor of a debtor, wiping more than $200,000 in Kevin Rosenberg;s student debt. Of course, the lenders will be appealing the case.However, Judge Morris, who presided over the case, wrote in her decision that “most people (bankruptcy professionals as well as lay individuals) believe it impossible to discharge student loans,” and that her ;Court will not participate in perpetuating these myths.;Reset Button has raised money from investors Craft Ventures,  Slow Ventures  and Jeff Morris Jr. of Lambda School, among others. The company declined to share its total amount of investment.;Society has been led to believe something for decades that is not true, which is probably the biggest initial challenge,; said founder and CEO Rob Hunter . ;One of the unfortunate things is the reason that many consumers believe incorrect information is because a lawyer told them that. So, that is a bit of an uphill battle to swim against.;",https://tcrn.ch/38oxZKv
1945105,2020-02-12T07:05:10,Ever Loved;s funeral marketplace undercuts undertakers,"Fifty percent of families are scared they can;t cover the cost of a funeral. They end up overpaying because no one wants to comparison shop amidst a tragedy. That;s why ex-Googler Alison Johnston;s  startup Ever Loved  built a free funeral crowdfunding tool. Now it;s addressing one of the most expensive parts of saying goodbye: burial. Today Ever Loved launches its online marketplace for caskets, urns, headstones and memorial jewelry.By sidestepping the overhead of a physical funeral home, Ever Loved can offer better prices while still earning a 10% margin. Its caskets cost 50% less than the average sold at a mortuary, according to the National Funeral Directors Association.When I called a local San Francisco funeral home, the high markups came into focus. They quoted me $2,795 for a casket sold for $1,200 on Ever Loved.;Most people don;t think to ; or don;t want to ; plan funerals in advance, which means that when someone passes away, the family is often scrambling,; Johnston tells me. ;When this rush to make decisions is paired with extreme grief, many people don;t do anywhere close to the same amount of research as they would with another several-thousand-dollar purchase. When combined with the fact that most funeral homes don;t publish their prices online, it;s easy for families to spend much more than they need to.;Johnston co-founded Ever Loved in late 2017 after a family member was diagnosed with terminal cancer. She discovered how few resources there were available for helping people plan and pay for funerals. She;d previously worked at Q&amp;A app Aardvark through its acquisition by Google, then started online tutoring startup InstaEDU that eventually sold to Chegg. The consumer website building and e-commerce tools she;d grown used to weren;t available in the funeral industry, so she set out to build them. Ever Loved has raised seed funding from Social Capital and gone through Y Combinator.Ever Loved co-founder and CEO Alison Johnston;Tech too often merely makes life and work easier for those who already have it good,; she told me last year. ;Tech that tempers tragedy is a welcome evolution for Silicon Valley.”Ever Loved;s first focus was its funeral crowdfunding tool that let families ask the decedent;s loved ones to help contribute to offset the costs. Donors could leave a tip for Ever Loved, but otherwise it charged nothing beyond credit card processing fees. The tool was paired with a memorial website builder that families could use for distributing invites and collecting memories. Now Ever Loved is helping people plan thousands of funerals per month with revenue up nearly 20X year-over-year.Now that it;s helping families raise money for remembrance services, Ever Loved wants to make sure they don;t get ripped off. The fact that there;s such low pricing transparency at funeral homes should clue you in that they try to pass off steep markups since customers might not have the energy to keep looking. ;The average funeral home only helps with a funeral once every three days, meaning that many funeral homes need to charge high prices in order to cover their own fixed costs,; Johnston explains. Remove the overhead costs and assist customers across geographies and there;s room for a strong business with more affordable prices. For example, a Stanford Blue Casket costs $990 on Ever Loved while one LA funeral home charges $1,600. The Last Supper Pieta Casket is $1,500 on Ever Loved but $6,580 from the funeral home. That funeral home had both of these listed under different names, further hindering the ability of customers to find a fair price.Ever Loved can also more quickly adapt to the diversification of burial options. Between concerns about costs, land use, environmental impact and connection to family and nature, many are looking beyond caskets. Cremation became more popular than burial in the U.S. in 2017. Liquid cremation is now legal in 18 states, and Washington just began allowing body composting.;We;re seeing a lot of independent providers popping up to do everything from turning your loved one;s ashes into a diamond ring to shooting their ashes into space to planting them under a tree in the forest,; says Johnston. Any single funeral home is unlikely to offer the breadth customers are looking for. ;Our goal is to make all of your options available to you in an easily digestible format.;Ever Loved;s business is protected by the FTC;s Funeral Rule that bars mortuaries from refusing or charging extra to handle a casket or urn purchased elsewhere. That means Ever Loved customers can combine shopping online with in-person memorial services from a local funeral home. Still, it;s a tough business. Startups like HaloLife, Clarity and After I Go have all shut down. Most others merely offer memorial sites, or funeral home search engines.That means Ever Loved;s biggest competitors, beyond the standard just accepting the local mortuary;s prices, are Google and Amazon. Often they surface the same prices as Ever Loved with comparable shipping, though Google could sometimes find a slight discount by buying straight from the manufacturer, while Amazon was missing some top brands. Costco and Walmart sell funeral products too.

1945407,2020-02-12T06:42:08,Orbital debris startup Astroscale chosen by JAXA for its first space junk removal mission,"Japanese orbital debris removal technology startup Astroscale  is going to be working with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency  (JAXA) on the agency;s first mission to remove some of the junk that currently exists on orbit. They;ve been selected by the agency to participate in its Commercial Removal of Debris Demonstration project (CRD2), which includes two separate mission phases that together will aim to accomplish the removal of a large body currently on orbit, the spent upper stage of a Japanese rocket.Astroscale, which was founded in 2013, is focused entirely on cleaning up orbital space, which it sees as a necessary step for long-term sustainable activity on orbit. Space debris has become a hot-button topic in the space industry, with current projections anticipating massive increases in the number of active satellites orbiting the planet, thanks to the uptick in satellite constellation projects in the works from commercial operators including SpaceX, Amazon and OneWeb.The JAXA mission aims to complete its first phase by the end of 2022, and Astroscale will support that phase by building, launching and operating a satellite that will observe and acquire data on the rocket upper stage that the second phase will seek to de-orbit. The goal is to find out more about its movement and the surrounding debris environment in order to set up a safe and successful removal.“The data obtained in Phase I of CRD2 is expected to reinforce the dangers of existing debris and the necessity to remove them,; said Astroscale founder and CEO Nobu Okada in a press release. ;Debris removal is still a new market and our mission has always been to establish routine debris removal services in space in order to secure orbital sustainability for the benefit of future generations. The international community is growing more aware of the risks of space debris and we are committed more than ever to turning this potential market into a reality.”Astroscale is also already involved in other orbital debris-removal projects, and plans to launch a demonstration mission of its ;End-of-Life Services; offering sometime in the second half of this year. This mission will be a world-first demo of commercial orbital debris removal if all goes to plan, a key step in proving that its technology can meet the needs of this growing opportunity.Earlier this year, a near-miss of two defunct orbital spacecraft made headlines, and observers noted that had a collision occurred, it would;ve resulted in a new debris cloud with ;at least hundreds; of new pieces of trackable debris. Astroscale and others like it could, combined with other initiatives like more granular tracking and information sharing among satellite operators, provide a much more sustainable in-space operating environment for the range of commercial activities either planned or in progress for orbital space.",https://tcrn.ch/39uq5PM

But when it comes to people crossing borders and setting up lives in new countries, they essentially leave behind their financial histories, starting again from scratch in their new homes. But there are signs of that starting to change. A startup called Nova Credit has built a facility to import financial histories from one country to another, and today it;s announcing a $50 million round of funding to grow that business to cover more countries.The funding is being led by Kleiner Perkins,  with a list of other big names also participating. They include Canapi Ventures, a new fund focused on fintech startups, as well as previous backers Index Ventures, General Catalyst and Nyca Partners. Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary;s fund Sound Ventures is also in this round, along with baseball legend Alex Rodriguez and U2 guitarist the Edge.Nova is not disclosing its valuation, but according to PitchBook, in the first-close of the round it was estimated at around $295 million. CEO and co-founder Misha Esipov would only say it was ;much higher; than the company;s valuation in its previous round ; supported by the facts that revenues grew four-fold in 2019, and that it now covers more than 1 billion consumer credit profiles, working out to over 50% of the most popular U.S. immigrant countries of origin.Prior to this Series B, the company had raised just under $20 million, which also included funding from Y Combinator  (where it was part of a 2016 cohort).Esipov ; who has worked as a banker at Goldman Sachs and at private equity firm Apollo, and himself is a first-generation Russian immigrant moving to the U.S. with his parents when he was three ; said he and co-founders Loek Janssen and Nicky Goulimis first came up with the idea for Nova when they were still graduate students at Stanford, where they turned to their own classmates to look for gaps in the market of financial services.;We made a discovery among the international students we surveyed, which was that many said they couldn’t get credit, cell phone plans, leases and anything else that required credit histories,; he said. ;Many of them said the same thing to us: ;I feel like a second-class citizen.; And that was the light-bulb moment for us. We saw it was a systemic problem, and four years later I believe we’re solving a decent share of this problem.;Nova;s solution is that it has built a digital framework that connects an individual;s credit history information from one country back into the country where the person is currently residing, creating a product that it refers to as a ;Credit Passport.;Nova partners with businesses that rely on this credit history in order to decide whether to do business with an individual. In cases where it comes up short in accessing an in-country history for a specific person ; for example, American Express, in evaluating a person;s credit history to determine whether it should issue a card for a particular applicant ; it can now use Nova to source a history from another market, using details provided by the user in question.Nova;s business model is that it pays a fee to the credit bureau where the records are originating in order to source the data, and it then charges the business that is making the request for the data.For now, the service is not global in a number of ways. The first is in terms of the geographies covered: Nova has so far only facilitated links between 11 countries, with the originating requests coming from the U.S. They include Australia, Canada, India, Kenya, Mexico and the U.K. Esipov said that the starting point came from close analysis of which countries send the most people to the U.S.The other is that the service is largely geared toward people who have a credit history to speak of in their previous country. For many immigrants to the U.S., that is not actually the case for a number of financial, political and other reasons.The strategy is to increasingly cover both of those bases better over time, Esipov said.For example, while there are only 11 countries ;live; at the moment, the company actually has deals with 19 countries currently, a list it hopes to grow more. The Dominican Republic and the Philippines will be the next two countries to launch. One reason for the relatively slow rollout is that this isn;t exactly a scalable problem with the same issues in each market, although it;s finally started to get some momentum.;It’s an absolute nightmare,; Esipov said with a laugh when I asked him about the challenges of scaling the business. ;Each country has its own complexities, whether it;s in terms of the partnership or technical complexity. Every market is different.; Some are surprising. He noted that France, for example, is the only G20 country without a centralised credit bureau, only a repository that logs ;bad marks,; not good behaviour. ;So we haven;t been able to develop a solution covering France so far.;He notes that it has taken Nova a few years to build these relationships. ;When we were still trying to find our footing, it was difficult, but now the five biggest credit agencies in the world work with us. We have established ourselves as the solution for cross-border credit reporting access.;And on the side of making the product something that can be useful for more than just the percentage of immigrants who came from the credit-using class in their previous countries ; the typical type of person who might end up at Stanford business school, if you will ; Nova is working on that, too.;There are a lot of potential strategies for those countries where central credit bureaus don’t exist,; Esipov said. ;We have to be creative in using potential data sources that we can find to say this is a new and good segment. There are alternative data sources, and we are exploring how to bring those into the U.S. market. But, if they are not as well-established, no matter how creative we are, it’s a matter of working with risk officers and trying to teach them, too.; Indeed, we are starting to see a rise of other services aiming at immigrants ; for example, new bank accounts launched by Remitly last week ; speaking to how multiple startups are tuning into demographics that have been traditionally overlooked, but now represent growth opportunities in what is otherwise a tight and competitive market with slowing growth.;In a competitive financial services industry with shifting demographics, developing a strategy to attract the growing newcomer segment has become a strategic necessity for banks to defend and grow market share,; said Gene Ludwig, managing partner of Canapi Ventures, in a statement. ;Nova Credit  stands out as the only enduring solution to financial access for the millions of newcomers who come to the US each year. They;ve assembled an exceptional, mission-driven team that has what it takes to bring systemic change to life.”It can;t come a moment too soon. Nova, citing research from Pew, notes that immigrants account for 55% of U.S. population growth, which will grow to 80% by 2050. Helping them get better integrated into the economy is a critical step for integrating into society.;Credit is fundamental to economic success, but today’s systems and infrastructure have not kept up with an increasingly mobile world,; said Ilya Fushman, a partner at Kleiner Perkins, in a statement. “Nova Credit is democratizing access to credit globally and we’re delighted to lead the Series B.",https://tcrn.ch/38mJja2
1945070,2020-02-12T06:15:55,Mike Volpi on the art of board membership,"										Mike Volpi						Contributor																Share on Twitter																Mike Volpi is a general partner at Index Ventures. Before co-founding the firm's San Francisco office with Danny Rimer, Volpi served as the chief strategy officer at Cisco Systems. 						More posts by this contributor								How open-source software took over the world							Much has been made about the roles and responsibilities of board members these days. This is especially true in the venture-backed startup world where there is an intimate and complex relationship between entrepreneurs and investors. With increasing scrutiny and growing pressure for accountability, the role of a board member has been thrust into the spotlight.I was fortunate to begin my service as a board member early in my career. For the past 20 years, I’ve had the privilege to serve on boards of companies of many shapes and sizes, ranging from startups to publicly traded companies and everything in between. As I reflect on those experiences, I first have to express my deep gratitude to all the CEOs, management teams and boards that I have had the fortune to work with. I’ve certainly grown enormously through each one of those experiences.My biggest observation is that these varied companies need very different board members. The nature of the business and the stage of the company define “value-added” as a director. That said, I have found that a board member can create value in a way that transcends the specifics of each company and its leaders. I write this post to try to abstract the essence of this very privileged role and share my experiences with a broader ecosystem. I also hope this can serve as a guide to entrepreneurs who are selecting investors and constructing boards.In that context, it is important to realize the peculiar nature of board directors. Our role, as such, is to help the company create greater shareholder value. Some might define that as being the “CEO’s boss.” Without a doubt, that is an oversimplification, or perhaps a misconception, of a board member’s duties. We are not the CEO’s boss. The role of the collective board is to be an advisor to the CEO and the management team, which, in some corner cases, is called upon to encourage changes in that management team. But, the relationship between a board and the company’s leadership is much more subtle in nature and is worthy of deeper inspection.Nature of the relationshipIn venture communities, we often oscillate between two extreme views of the role of a board member. One view is that a board is there to be “chief cheerleaders.” That view posits that a board member is there to support the CEO and the founders of a company, to “add value” in the context of tips and advice, introductions, recruiting efforts, marketing, PR and general cheering. In extreme cases, that has even led to the abdication of voting rights and governance to the founders and CEO. While this view is tempting in an era where founders and CEOs are the decision-makers for which VCs they elect as investors in their company, it’s also a very short-sighted view of the role. There is no doubt that a director should be helpful and, as a company leader, it might feel great to have an investor “at your service.” But, is an entrepreneur simply purchasing a brand and adding a helper or are they genuinely deriving shareholder value by having a blind supporter on the board?The opposite extreme is the view that a board member should instruct the CEO and the management team on how to run the company and ultimately be the “judge and jury” of the management team’s performance. This relationship is also fraught with risk. CEOs, founders and management teams are far more versed in the business that they are operating than any investor. They know the internal details, the nuances of the business, the products, the market and the competitive dynamics. By and large, they are far better equipped to run the business than any board member could be.I have personally found that the healthiest relationship between a board director and the CEO is one that is peer-like. The board member’s function in that context is one where, as a good friend would, they are supportive but candid and transparent about their view on the state of the company, its challenges and its opportunities. In doing so, the dialog that occurs will be one which is genuine in nurturing the company rather than a cat-and-mouse game or a love-fest.The mirrorOne of the analogies I often use for the role of a board is that of being a “mirror” to the management team. Entrepreneurs, by their nature, live on a roller-coaster ride that is matching their startup’s journey. Their perception of the business is often an amplification of the current state of the business. The highs are often more optimistic than the business might really deserve and the lows are often much lower than they should be. The board should reflect a snapshot of the reality of the business. All businesses, both the most successful and the somewhat troubled, involve a lot of sausage-making. There are aspects that are not working well that shouldn’t be brushed aside or ignored, but should be focal points of improvement. Conversely, when things aren’t going well, entrepreneurs can often be too critical of their own business.By placing things in the context of other experiences, the board member should aid the entrepreneurs in “normalizing” the state of the company. Sometimes, reminding the leadership teams that they are neither the masters of the universe nor a losing locker room makes all the difference. All too often, boards have tendencies of “jumping on the pile” and accentuating the entrepreneur’s perception of the business for better or worse ; which ultimately provides little value.ContextCommand of the context is one of the most important values boards can provide. While entrepreneurs have the deepest knowledge of their own business, they do not have the benefit of having seen many other companies that are like them. Especially in the startup universe where there are so many common patterns that recur regularly, the ability to provide the comparative context is very valuable. These recurring patterns exist in almost every aspect of a business. Whether it’s in strategy, go-to-market, executive hiring and firing, market adoption versus monetization, and many other attributes, there are lessons that a new business can learn, both positively or negatively, from others who have walked in their shoes earlier on. Not all of those lessons apply. Each business is a snowflake ; unique in its own way. But, for the leadership of a company, being able to compare and contrast the situations with those that have come before can be of enormous value in shaping the right business decisions.It is also incredibly important for boards to encourage long-term thinking. Most management teams think their job is to deliver the short-term quarter-by-quarter gains to appease the board. To some extent, yes, but it;s actually the board;s job to encourage and allow the company to think long-term. For company leaders, it is particularly more tricky because their own business is right there, staring them in the face. A “value-added” board should help in thinking about the longer-term implications of a company’s decisions. Not so much in just the burning issue of the moment, but in the relative impact of that decision on the company’s long-term prospects. The journey of a board member often spans many years, sometimes more than a decade. It’s important to have that in mind when dispensing advice.My friend Peter Fenton  at Benchmark is extremely effective at this. Peter will almost always leave the ultimate decisions to the CEO he’s working with, but he has a way of using compelling examples from the many successful companies he has been involved with as anecdotes to help steer the CEOs to the right decisions. The success stories have a powerful sway on the thinking of CEOs and they are rich in context because they demonstrate actual case studies rather than hypotheticals.NetworkEspecially for a young business, the ability to tap into a board’s network can be of massive value. Networks exist in almost every context to help recruit the right people, to construct impactful business development relationships, to provide strategic advice or deliver customers or investors. The list of valuable networks is endless. A board member should come equipped with those networks and generously and tirelessly provide entrepreneurs with access to them. Surely, not all of these networks are equally useful but, if accessed correctly, some can have transformational effects on a company’s prospects. Board members should be able to tap into these networks at the right time (careful not to over-expose startups to networks that are premature, or useless in the moment). And, these networks should be fresh and relevant.One of the beauties of rich networks is that they often provide access to the person that is best suited to give the best advice to the entrepreneur. Many VCs are “jacks-of-all-trades.” The best advice on specific topics should come from a true expert. The director’s job is to make sure that advice is available at the right time. With a good board, the right person is always one call away.The master of the universe of networks is Reid Hoffman. I serve on Aurora’s board with him and no one wields a network quite like Reid. His ability to bring just the right person into the dialog at just the right moment is amazing. For the founder of LinkedIn, that’s no surprise, really. He is truly as good as they come.What happens in betweenFeedback during board meetings is actually a fraction of the ways in which board members should provide value. In fact, a board member that surfaces only at the board meetings is shirking their duties. The meetings themselves are valuable because they represent an opportunity to bring together the collective thinking and contrast views, but not to regurgitate “state of the business” information that should be disseminated and absorbed outside of that venue. It’s also the case that many of the most significant conversations between a board member and a CEO occur in private, where conversations can have continuity and consistency achievable only in the context of a 1:1.The most effective board members have multiple conversations with their CEO and executive team in between board meetings. This allows them to be current and relevant to the company rather than getting caught up in the usual business platitudes that are commonplace in board meetings. (If I had a nickel for every time I heard the phrase “companies are bought and not sold” in a board meeting;).The best at this was Coach ; the great Bill Campbell . When he and I served on Opsware’s board, I would visit Marc and Ben from time to time in their offices. Without fail, Bill would always be there. He took context to a new level. What all that context gave Bill was an incisive ability to understand what the real issues were and how they should be addressed. He truly became a coach to the CEO.Availability and relevanceStartups are real time. Issues surface every day and every moment. Leaders seek “micro-advice” in the moment, all the time. A board member should have the availability to respond to entrepreneurs when needed. Sometimes that means calls at 10 pm. At other times, that means five or 10 text messages in a day. Sometimes these “micro-advice” moments are extremely impactful: how to deal with a particular customer, how to close a candidate, whether or not to fire someone. At other times, they are not pivotal. However, they often provide the CEO with the ammunition to make a tough decision, or simply the ability to offer a moment of empathy. A director’s ability to be available in those key moments is incredibly valuable and irreplaceable. Providing that level of availability can sometimes be a challenge for board members ; after all, we all have action-filled busy days. But, the board member who is able to find the time earns the right to become the proverbial “first call” for the entrepreneur. Such “micro-advice” also provides the board members with the ability to be relevant at all times to the leadership team of a company. The moments when CEOs need another perspective don’t show up neatly five times per year at pre-scheduled times.Delivering a message that can be heardParticularly with VC-rich boards, I have found that all-too-often we enjoy hearing ourselves talk perhaps a bit too much. Sometimes, the quantity of airtime is confused with value. A board member should recognize that their counterpart can only absorb a finite amount of insight at any given time. My rule of thumb is a board member can, at most, provide two or three key insights at a board meeting. More than that, and it’s overkill.Furthermore, those perspectives should be conveyed in a meaningful and concise way. And, perhaps most importantly, they need to be delivered in a way that the message is heard. Entrepreneurs are very different in the way they “hear.” Some are entirely open to different perspectives, others prefer being asked intelligent questions that they can pursue. Well-thought-out questions often have the most powerful effect on shaping an executive’s thinking.Ultimately, no one likes to be told what to do. CEOs need to “own” the issues and deal with them operationally, and every day. Ownership is much easier when the idea comes from the CEO. So, the concept of delivering a message well is often to let the CEOs come to their own conclusions rather than spelling out what they should be doing. This is often more true with experienced operational leaders. All they need is a cue. The rest they can figure out themselves.My best mentor in this dimension is Andy Rachleff . Andy invited me to join Equinix’s  board many years ago. I also served on Opsware’s board with him. Now the tables have turned and he’s the CEO at Wealthfront while I am his board director. He will frequently remind me that if a board member gives one good strategic insight per board meeting, that’s a big win. If you offer two in one meeting, you get the “star award for board members.” That is a powerful reminder that less is often more.The subtle artThe more I serve on boards, the more I appreciate the responsibilities and demands that come from being a board director. In the modern era of venture capital, we are tempted to distill board service as a “right” or a byproduct of investing or, worse, simply a “badge of honor.” Nothing could be further from the truth. Board membership is a privilege and a nuanced responsibility that can have a transformational impact on businesses. Sometimes investors, independents and entrepreneurs forget this. Entrepreneurs should expect a great deal from their boards ; not as blind supporters but as true copilots. Likewise, board members should not view board membership as a list of icons on their LinkedIn profile, but as a subtle yet massively impactful role they play in the creation of great businesses. When these relationships function properly, the two parties become true partners in the entrepreneurial journey.",https://tcrn.ch/31UVGYA

The company reports it has now raised almost $13 million.You may not realize it, but the largest companies in the world, like big banks, insurance companies, airlines and retailers, still use mainframes. These companies require the massive transaction processing capabilities of these stalwart machines, but find it;s difficult to get the valuable data out for more modern analytics capabilities. This is the hard problem that Model9 is attempting to solve.Gil Peleg, CEO and co-founder at Model9, says that his company;s technology is focused on helping mainframe users get their data to the cloud or other on-prem storage. ;Mainframe data is locked behind proprietary storage that is inaccessible to anything that;s happening in the evolving, fast-moving technology world in the cloud. And this is where we come in with patented technology that enables mainframes to read and write data directly to the cloud or any non-mainframe distributed storage system,; Peleg explained.This has several important use cases. For starters, it can act as a disaster recovery system, eliminating the need to maintain expensive tape backups. It also can move this data to the cloud where customers can apply modern analytics to data that was previously inaccessible.The company;s solution works with AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and IBM;s cloud solution. It also works with other on-prem storage solutions like EMC, Nutanix, NetApp and Hitatchi. He says the idea is to give customers true hybrid cloud options, whether a private cloud or a public cloud provider.;Ideally our customers will deploy a hybrid cloud topology and benefit from both worlds. The mainframe keeps doing what it should do as a reliable, secure, trusted [machine], and the cloud can manage the scale and the rapidly growing amount of data and provide the new modern technologies for disaster recovery, data management and analytics,; he said.The company was founded in 2016 and took a couple of years to develop the solution. Today, the company is working with a number  of large organizations using mainframes. Peleg says he wants to use the money to expand the sales and marketing operation to grow the market for this solution.The mainframe business is alive and well, as IBM announces new z15",https://tcrn.ch/37kXPhd
1945385,2020-02-12T06:01:18,Deep Instinct nabs $43M for a deep-learning cybersecurity solution that can suss an attack before it happens,"The worlds of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity have become deeply entwined in recent years, as organizations work to keep up with ; and ideally block ; increasingly sophisticated malicious hackers. Today, a startup that;s built a deep learning solution that it claims can both identify and stop even viruses that have yet to be identified has raised a large round of funding from some big strategic partners.Deep Instinct, which uses deep learning both to learn how to identify and stop known viruses and other hacking techniques, as well as to be able to identify completely new approaches that have not been identified before, has raised $43 million in a Series C.The funding is being led by Millennium New Horizons, with Unbound (a London-based investment firm founded by Shravin Mittal), LG and Nvidia all participating. The investment brings the total raised by Deep Instinct  to $100 million, with HP and Samsung among its previous backers. The tech companies are all strategics, in that (as in the case of HP) they bundle and resell Deep Instinct;s solutions, or use them directly in their own services.The Israeli-based company is not disclosing valuation, but notably, it is already profitable.Targeting as-yet unknown viruses is becoming a more important priority as cybercrime grows. CEO and founder Guy Caspi notes that currently there are more than 350,000 new machine-generated malware created every day ;with increasingly sophisticated evasion techniques, such as zero-days and APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats).; Nearly two-thirds of enterprises have been compromised in the past year by new and unknown malware attacks originating at endpoints, representing a 20% increase from the previous year, he added. And zero-day attacks are now four times more likely to compromise organizations. ;Most cyber solutions on the market can’t protect against these new types of attacks and have therefore shifted to a detect-response approach,; he said, ;which by design means that they ;assume a breach; will happen.;While there is already a large profusion of AI-based cybersecurity tools on the market today, Caspi notes that Deep Instinct takes a critically different approach because of its use of deep neural network algorithms, which essentially are set up to mimic how a human brain thinks.;Deep Instinct is the first and currently the only company to apply end-to-end deep learning to cybersecurity,; he said in an interview. In his view, this provides a more advanced form of threat protection than the common traditional machine learning solutions available in the market, which rely on feature extractions determined by humans, which means they are limited by the knowledge and experience of the security expert, and can only analyze a very small part of the available data (less than 2%, he says). ;Therefore, traditional machine learning-based solutions and other forms of AI have low detection rates of new, unseen malware and generate high false-positive rates.; There;s been a growing body of research that supports this idea, although we;ve not seen many deep learning cybersecurity solutions emerge as a result (not yet, anyway).He adds that deep learning is the only AI-based autonomous system that can ;learn from any raw data, as it’s not limited by an expert’s technological knowledge.; In other words, it;s not based just on what a human inputs into the algorithm, but is based on huge swathes of big data, sourced from servers, mobile devices and other endpoints, that are input in and automatically read by the system.This also means that the system can be used in turn across a number of different end points. Many machine learning-based cybersecurity solutions, he notes, are geared at Windows environments. That is somewhat logical, given that Windows and Android account for the vast majority of attacks these days, but cross-OS attacks are now on the rise.While Deep Instinct specializes in preventing first-seen, unknown cyberattacks like APTs and zero-day attacks, Caspi notes that in the past year there has been a rise in both the amount and the impact of cyberattacks covering other areas. In 2019, Deep Instinct saw an increase in spyware and ransomware on top of an increase in the level of sophistication of the attacks that are being used, specifically with more file-less attacks using scripts and powershell, “living off the land” attacks and the use of weaponized documents like Microsoft Office files and PDFs. These sit alongside big malware attacks like Emotet, Trickbot, New ServeHelper and Legion Loader.Today the company sells services both directly and via partners (like HP), and it;s mainly focused on enterprise users. But since there is very little in the way of technical implementation (;Our solution is mostly autonomous and all processes are automated [and] deep learning brain is handling most of the security,; Caspi said), the longer-term plan is to build a version of the product that consumers could adopt, too.With a large part of antivirus software often proving futile in protecting users against attacks these days, that could come as a welcome addition to the market, despite how crowded it already is.“There is no shortage of cybersecurity software providers, yet no company aside from Deep Instinct has figured out how to apply deep learning to automate malware analysis,” said Ray Cheng, partner at Millennium New Horizons, in a statement. “What excites us most about Deep Instinct is its proven ability to use its proprietary neural network to effectively detect viruses and malware no other software can catch. That genuine protection in an age of escalating threats, without the need of exorbitantly expensive or complicated systems is a paradigm change.”",https://tcrn.ch/3bx3FiY

And today, one of the more prominent fintech startups is announcing a large round of funding, from a mix of strategic investors, to keep growing its business.Dublin-based Fenergo builds solutions for banks and other financial management companies to help with regulatory compliance, customer onboarding and other ;lifecycle management; requirements. It has raised $80 million in funding at a post-money valuation of around $800 million, one of the bigger rounds for an Irish fintech company to date. (I;m not counting Stripe, which was founded by Irish brothers but is based out of San Francisco.)The funding is coming from two investors: the multinational banking giant ABN AMRO (via its Ventures arm) and DXC Technology, which provides a wide range of IT, systems integration and consulting services to businesses (and thus a key partner for a company like Fenergo). The pair has taken a 10 percent stake in the company.It will be used to continue building more products and for acquisitions—a notable point as we are in the middle of a strong period of consolidation in the world of fintech. With this round, Fenergo has raised around $155 million to date, with previous backers including strategics like BNP Paribas, Investec, Ergo and Insight Partners.“ABN AMRO and DXC Technology’s investment and partnership with Fenergo is testament to the credibility of both firms. They will be joining the ranks of BNP Paribas, Insight Venture Partners and our other equity holders,” said Spencer Lake, vice chairman of Fenergo, in a statement. “We look forward to further accelerating digital transformation, enabling better client experiences and delivering even greater value to our shared customers going forward.”While banks might, in some regards, look a lot like tech companies ; and for that reason, in places like London, there has long been a push and pull between tech and finance when it comes to recruiting top tech talent ; there is a case to be made for startups that are built around the idea of hatching and developing interesting technology for the banking sector, while at the same time not competing against it directly. That is one reason why Fenergo has so many strategic investors.;Ultimately, we only exist to serve the needs of our customers,; said Marc Murphy, Fenergo;s founder and CEO, in a statement. ;Their pedigrees, deep experience and industry knowledge make them both ideal investment partners for Fenergo. ABN ARMO joins BNP Paribas on our list of clients that are also investors. Our goal is to ensure they can digitally transform, be regulatory assured and able to deliver award-winning customer experiences.”So while you might think of Fenergo as sitting in the same ;fintech; category as Transferwise, Starling and the many other startups building services that are disrupting and stealing away customers from traditional financial services providers, it;s more of a financially-focused enterprise services business, giving bigger banks the tools to help compete and generally run their businesses better.;This investment will contribute to ABN AMRO’s strategic priority to build a future proof bank and fight financial crime. We are impressed with the management team and solution Fenergo offers,; Hugo Bongers, Director, ABN AMRO Ventures, said. ;In addition, this gives us additional exposure to a group of tier one investors.”Fenergo;s services speak to a lot of the headaches that banks have to deal with in the new era of digital banking. That includes a host of regulatory requirements; client lifecycle management (onboarding and making digital interfaces usable); and rolling out digital interfaces for the services that banks typically offer (corporate/institutional banking, asset management, private banking and wealth management); as well as client and regulatory technology for financial services. Fenergo also, critically, covers internal-facing services, too, so that the data gleaned from the client-facing products can more easily parsed.The company today has 70 customers on its books, which may not sound like a lot until you consider that the customers are leviathans like ANZ, PNC, Banc of California, National Australia Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, UBS Asset Management, Anglo Gulf Trading Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, First Abu Dhabi Bank, Tricor, Exos Financial and Mizuho, in addition to the two strategics announced today. ABN AMRO alone has nearly €200 billion in assets under management, so providing services for this small but at the same time huge list has proven to be a lucrative route for Fenergo, which has had growth of 21 percent in its revenues this year.The growth of the company is also coming at a notable time for financial technology startups in Europe.London has traditionally been seen as one of the world;s financial centers, a focus specifically around its position in investment banking. But with the UK;s departure from the European Union, some believe that position could be up for grabs, or at least disrupted a little more. Departures of ventures like N26 from the U.K. market would seem to underscore that idea. However, I;d argue that you have to look at any actual underlying business before jumping to any conclusions. If a company is thriving, would it leave, for example? Or is the implication here that the prospects for thriving have now been cut?In any case, Dublin has, for the last several years, emerged as a very critical hub for a number of technology and other businesses. They have turned to the city to base their international HQs, to tap into its lower cost of living, English-language lingua franca, ability to attract talent, and sympathetic tax policies. Fenergo;s positioning in the city and its growth are a testament to that continuing trend as it plays out in the worlds of enterprise and fintech services.",https://tcrn.ch/37nFZKq
1927077,2020-02-11T22:47:21,"European founders look to new markets, aim for profitability","To get a better sense of what lies ahead for the European startup ecosystem, we spoke to several investors and entrepreneurs in the region about their impressions and lessons learned from 2019, along with their predictions for 2020.We asked for blunt responses, and we weren;t disappointed.These responses have been edited for clarity and length.Kenny Ewan, founder/CEO, Wefarm (London)I’ve often been faced with questions around how we can generate revenue in markets like Africa. There has historically been a view that you can do something good or you can generate revenue. Companies that talk about developing markets usually get squarely lumped into the former. While mission-led companies achieving tremendous growth has been talked about for a while, 2019 has been a year I have felt conversations with investors and others really begin to shift to the reality of that and it’s thanks to more and more proof points being delivered by startups across the board.As more and more businesses begin to realize they don’t need to wait for the internet to descend from the sky for these markets to become hubs of commerce and innovation — and see that it’s already happening — I believe 2020 will continue to witness more and more historic tech companies shifting their focus to markets like Africa and that there will be more coverage and discussion as a result.",https://tcrn.ch/39wTFo1
1943599,2020-02-11T20:58:06,Israel;s maturing cybersecurity startup ecosystem,"It often feels like half of the new security startups that receive funding are from Israel. As YL Ventures; Yoav Leitersdorf and Ofer Schreiber wrote last month, investments in Israeli cybersecurity startups increased to $1.4 billion last year, with average seed rounds of $4.7 million, up 30.5 percent from 2018.I spent some time on the ground at CyberTech Global in Tel Aviv a few weeks ago, and the energy in the nation;s security ecosystem was palpable. But this is also an ecosystem that has changed a bit over the last few years as its first wave of startups have been acquired, gone public or shut down. Now, these entrepreneurs are coming back for their second acts, which creates a different dynamic.There are a lot of reasons why Israel excels in cybersecurity, but one of them is undoubtedly its talent pool, which is fed by intelligence units like 8200 and 81. Indeed, it;s exceedingly unusual to come across security startup founders in the country who did not receive their initial training in the intelligence services. This experience also gives these founders a network of potential co-founders and employees right from the get-go.It;s worth noting, though, that while more than half of the workforce at Unit 8200 is female, that number does not translate to the same number of cybersecurity founders in the country, though that is slowly changing.For a long time, Israeli startups had a bit of a reputation for selling early instead of trying to build a massive company. That;s changing a bit now, in large part because the founders themselves may have already sold their first company and aren;t looking for that life-changing sale anymore — and because they now have the experience that gives them the confidence to build larger companies.",https://tcrn.ch/39rmFxh
1945213,2020-02-11T17:09:58,Spaceflight Industries to sell its satellite rideshare launch business to Japan;s Mitsui &#038; Co. and Yamasa,"Spaceflight Industries,  owner of both Spaceflight, Inc. and BlackSky, is selling the Spaceflight, Inc. portion of its business to Japanese industrial corporation Mitsui &amp; Co. and Yamasa . The pair will own the company in a 50/50 joint venture after its closing. The deal will see Spaceflight continue to operate as an independent business based in the U.S. and headquartered in Seattle, with the same mission of providing rideshare launch services for small satellite payloads.Meanwhile, Spaceflight Industries will use the funds generated from the sale (the terms of the deal were not disclosed) to re-invest in its BlackSky business. BlackSky is an Earth observation company that deals in geospatial intelligence. It currently operates four satellites in orbit, with eight more planned to join its constellation sometime later this year.The deal also means that Mistui &amp; Co, which is one of Japan;s largest businesses and operates in infrastructure, energy production, IT, food, consumer products, mining, chemicals and more, will now be in the rocket launch rideshare business as well. Mitsui also has an aerospace arm that includes a space business which provides satellite development, launch and operation services. It noted in a press release that Spaceflight will become ;the cornerstone; of its space strategy pending close of the deal.Spaceflight has been offering its services since 2010, launching a total of 271 satellites on 29 separate rocket launches. In 2020, Spaceflight is planning 10 missions. The company;s business seems poised to grow as more launch providers and more small satellite operators enter the market, with many predictions indicating sharp uptakes in orbit-based businesses to come over the next decade.This arrangement is perhaps indicative of things to come in the space industry, as more young companies look at their overall business and determine how best to delineate things to continue their growth and return funds on investment to stay on mission. SpaceX,  for instance, has confirmed it;s looking at spinning out its Starlink business and taking that public, a move that could generate significant funds for it to then funnel back into its core launch business in pursuit of its goals of making humans multi-planetary.The deal still has to undergo review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) because there;s a national security interest involved, given Spaceflight;s past work. This is expected to take multiple months, and the companies say they anticipate the deal will close sometime during Q2 2020 if everything is approved.",https://tcrn.ch/2uBGqmY
1945138,2020-02-11T16:05:50,Profitability expectations ding Lyft despite better-than-expected growth,"Hello and welcome back to our regular look at private companies, public markets and the gray space in between.This afternoon we;re digging into Lyft;s earnings results, unpacking the company;s performance, the market;s expectations and why shares in the American ride-hailing giant are off in after-hours trading.Lyft;s  earnings — following Uber;s own results that promised investors a quicker-than-anticipated path to (adjusted) profits — and the market;s reaction to its performance, provide a good frame for evaluating investors; appetite for profits against growth. It;s a topic that;s important for startup founders and private-market investors alike.Our investigation today is contentedly straightforward. We;ll start with the big numbers, drill into comparative performance and then weigh what the market is telling us.Lyft;s key Q4 2019 resultsIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Lyft;s revenue came in at $1.017 billion, a gain of 52% compared to its year-ago result of $669.5 million. Sticking to the growth side of things, the company;s ;active rider; count rose from 18.59 million to 22.91 million from Q4 2018 to Q4 2019, a gain of 23%. Lyft;s active riders also spent 23% more year-over-year, reaching $44.40 in the final quarter of last year.Turning to losses, Lyft;s net loss (a metric that includes all costs) was $356.0 million in the quarter, a sharply worse result than its $248.9 million net loss in Q4 2018. The company;s adjusted net loss, however, was $121.4 million, an improvement from its year-ago $238.5 million adjusted net loss.Turning to adjusted EBITDA, a heavily adjusted profit metric, Lyft lost $130.7 million in Q4 2019, an improvement on its Q4 2018 adjusted EBITDA loss of $251.1 million.Investors had expected Lyft to report just $985.8 million in revenue and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $163.2 million. The street had also anticipated 100,000 fewer active riders and slightly slimmer revenue per active rider. So, Lyft beat expectations regarding growth, user count and health and for adjusted losses.And yet Lyft;s shares are off over 4% in after-hours trading. While Lyft;s stock has recovered from lows set in October, 2019, the company;s equity is now more than $20 down from its IPO price, taking into account its post-earnings movement.Why Lyft;s stock should fall after beating expectations and not changing its profit forecast might appear a bit confusing. It;s not.Damn you, Uber",https://tcrn.ch/2SkfZLR

Recent data suggests that cybersecurity investing could reach $250 billion by 2023, and spending rose in 2019 more than any other industry. If that pace keeps up, there;s little to suggest that the cybersecurity ;bubble; will burst any time soon.A number of cybersecurity companies are firmly in the club of private companies worth $1 billion or more. These unicorns represent some of the best talent, technologies and offerings in cybersecurity, but the club is getting crowded. Now that CrowdStrike and Cloudflare  have graduated to the public market, there are a number of cybersecurity companies that could make the leap.Tanium",https://tcrn.ch/2vq2pxc
1944901,2020-02-11T09:05:54,N26 exits UK market following Brexit,"German fintech startup N26 is shutting down its operations in the U.K. Customers who opened a bank account in the U.K. will have to transfer their deposits, spend everything with their card or withdraw money at an ATM, as all accounts will be automatically closed on April 15, 2020.Many European fintech companies take advantage of a European process called passporting. It lets you apply for a license to operate as a bank or a financial service in an EU member state and then expand to all EU member states.As you may have guessed, N26  has to exit from the U.K. banking market because it currently has a European banking license through the central bank of Germany. Passporting is going to change following Brexit.In particular, European companies that operate in the U.K. using inward passporting have to follow a new application process in order to continue operating in the U.K.;The timings and framework outlined in the EU Withdrawal Agreement mean that the company will in due course be unable to operate in the UK with its European banking licence,” N26 writes in a statement. N26 users in other markets won’t be affected by this change.N26 also faces a ton of competition in the U.K. from Monzo, Starling and in some ways Revolut. It’s also possible that N26 didn’t want to invest a lot of time and money in order to set up a proper subsidiary company in the U.K. with its own banking license.You can no longer sign up in the U.K. If you’re an existing customer, everything will work normally until April 15. You should empty your bank account, move your recurring payments to another bank, identify all your subscriptions, direct debits and deposits and move them to another bank.On April 15, you won’t be able to access your account. Your card will be deactivated. Direct debits and deposits will bounce as well. If you have a premium subscription, N26 is going to stop charging you for your N26 You or N26 Metal subscription from March 14.",https://tcrn.ch/2SfBiho
1944823,2020-02-11T08:01:15,Alpha Foods raises $28 million for its vegetarian prepared foods,"Alpha Foods, the vegetarian prepared food manufacturer, has raised $28 million in financing for its portfolio of vegetarian burritos, tamales, nuggets, pizzas, burgers, patties and sausages.The Glendale, Calif.-based company was launched by Loren Wallis, the founder of the dairy substitute, Good Karma Foods, and Cole Orobetz, a former director with the agricultural debt lending firm Avrio Capital.First launched in 2015, Alpha Foods  previously raised $12 million in financing from investment firms like New Crop Capital  and AccelFoods,  whose other brands include Kite Hill, Good Catch, BRAMi and Evoke Healthy Foods.As more Americans move to supplement their diets with plant-based products, companies like Alpha Foods have found willing investors for new food brands. The company;s new round was led by AccelFoods, with existing investors, including New Crop Capital, Green Monday Ventures and Blue Horizon, also participating.Companies like Alpha compete with huge consumer packaged goods companies like Kellogg;s (through its Morningstar Farms line of vegetarian products) and Nestlé (through Sweet Earth Foods).While the Morningstar Farms brand might seem a bit stale, the market has been reinvigorated through the marketing muscle and venture dollars supplied by companies like Beyond Meat  and Impossible Foods,  whose products have captured contracts from some of the world;s biggest fast food chains ; including McDonald;s, KFC  and Burger King.Alpha Foods said it will use the latest money to launch new products, make new hires and expand its distribution channels nationally and internationally.The company is already sold in well over 9,000 stores at chains including Wegmans, Walmart,  Kroger and Publix.“As more and more people actively seek out plant-based options, whether for their health or the environment, we are looking to expand our innovations within the category and bring easy to prepare products to a wider audience,” said Cole Orobetz, co-founder and president of Alpha Foods, in a statement.The sale of pre-prepared plant-based meals reached $387 million in 2019, up 6% over the past year, according to data from the Good Food Institute.“We are in the early days of plant-based consumption. As a portable, functional food business geared towards the newly emergent flexitarian consumer, the Alpha platform meets all of its customers; snack and mealtime needs,” said AccelFoods Managing Partner Jordan Gaspar. “We couldn’t be prouder to lead this strong nexus of collaborative investors, who had the opportunity to organically build trust this past year allowing for an incredibly successful outcome in this financing.”",https://tcrn.ch/37ivzLW
1943920,2020-02-11T08:00:44,Sixgill raises $15M to expand its dark web intelligence platform,"Sixgill,  an Israeli cyberthreat intelligence company that specializes in monitoring the deep and dark web, today announced that it has raised a $15 million funding round led by Sonae IM, a fund based in Portugal, and London-based REV Venture Partners. Crowdfunding platform OurCrowd also participated in the round, as did previous investors Elron and Terra Venture Partners.According to Crunchbase, this brings the company;s total funding to $21 million to date.Sixgill, which was founded in 2014, plans to use the new funding to expand its efforts in North America, EMEA and APAC. In addition to expanding its geographic focus, Sixgill plans to expand its product;s capabilities, including its Dynamic CVE Rating.Its current customer base mostly includes large enterprises, law enforcement and other government agencies, as well as other security providers.Given its focus, that client list doesn;t come as a surprise. The company uses its technology to automatically monitor dark web forums and marketplaces for potential threats and then find those that could affect its clients. Users can either access Sixgill through its SaaS platform or install it on-premises. For enterprises and agencies that don;t have their own staff to run the service, Sixgills also offers access to its internal analysts.;Sixgill uses advanced automation and artificial intelligence technologies to provide accurate, contextual intelligence to customers. The solution integrates seamlessly into the platforms that security teams use to orchestrate, automate, and manage security events,; said Sharon Wagner, CEO of Sixgill. ;The market has made it clear that Sixgill has built a powerful real-time engine for more effective handling of the rapidly expanding threat landscape; this investment will position us for significant growth and expansion in 2020.;",https://tcrn.ch/2tRQUOU
1944684,2020-02-11T07:21:15,"Google backs productivity startup building algorithmic inbox for Slacks, emails and texts","There have been plenty of stories written about the so-called ;Slack-lash; and the growing unrest among workers dealing with DM interruptions that take their attention away from the task at hand. Slack is a poster child for the problem, but VCs have invested heavily in a number of collaboration tools over the past several years that have compartmentalized chat and commenting systems and have left workers reeling.It seems fairly likely that we;ve reached peak VC interest in collaboration, but VCs are dealing with any slowdown by betting more heavily on tools that help workers make sense of the panoply of slick interfaced messaging tools. The latest bet, ;nuffsaid, is, yes, yet another productivity startup, though one that seems devoted to making the messaging realities of 2020 employment a bit more tolerable.The Utah startup is emerging from stealth, launching the first element of their productivity platform in early access, and disclosing that they;ve raised $4.3 million in seed funding from General Catalyst,  Google;s Gradient Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Work Life Ventures, SV Angel and Wasabi Ventures.The oddly named company is releasing its first oddly named product, ;nflow, into early access, bringing multiple collaboration platforms and a calendar into a single inbox. Just as the algorithmic timeline shaped how we digest the firehose of social media content, algorithmic inboxes might be the solution to a Slack-lash. And ;nuffsaid is taking this algorithmic approach for prioritizing Slack messages, as well as emails, texts and Zoom messages, with ;nflow. The searchable unified inbox brings all of your messages into a single app, letting you know what;s urgent and what can probably wait until you;re finished taking care of the task at hand.;We think there;s going to be an entire category of products that are all about adding AI into existing workflows. With ;nflow, we think we;re taking our first baby step to our vision of that future,; CEO and co-founder Chris Hicken tells TechCrunch. Hicken was previously COO of UserTesting.One of the more exciting elements of ;nflow is the way it brings the calendar inside the communications hub. Google Calendar is still among the more estranged elements of productivity workflows. Using messages and emails as the basis for calendar events has always been a wishlist item, but the integration is rarely tight enough. Although ;nuffsaid;s drag-and-drop interface for creating calendar events while tagging team members and adding additional info showcases seems to be a pretty attractive solution, I;ll wait until I can poke around the app myself before making any full-throated endorsements.The ;nuffsaid team says ;nflow will launch commercially at (a rather pricey) $25 per month, but that people who sign up for their early access waitlist will unlock a lifetime rate of $10 per month.The team of 18 has bigger near-term ambitions than the product they;re launching in early access today. If ;nflow represents a more mass-market approach to delivering a productivity tool to workers frustrated by a messaging overload, their future launches signify a desire to dig deeper into specific enterprise workflows and bring specific types of teams on board.Over the summer, the company plans to roll out a separate AI-driven customer success module that integrates with a variety of apps to give workers more actionable insights on what tasks are the most critical to maintaining and building customer relationships. The startup plans to build and roll out dedicated versions of the module for engineering, product and marketing, as well.;There are so many collaboration tools, what I like about ;nuffsaid is that it;s where the work is actually happening and they;re not asking users to change their procedures,; General Catalyst Managing Director Niko Bonatsos tells TechCrunch. ;Users still have the same email address, they;re still contacting their customers the same ways, they don;t have to start doing unnatural things that disrupt their workflows.;",https://tcrn.ch/2Sw7bkQ

The funding will be used by Adranos to build out its manufacturing capability, and to pursue additional key hires to build out its team.Adranos is building a new kind of solid rocket propellant called ;ALITEC,; which the company says can both increase the overall performance of a rocket versus traditional solid fuels, and get rid of dangerous hydrochloric acid emissions that result from burning the existing aluminum-based variety. ALITEC, which uses an aluminum-lithium alloy, was discovered by Adranos co-founder and CTO Brandon Terry during his PhD work at Purdue University .The target markets for Adranos with ALITEC include the defense industry, where it says its solid fuel can be used to both extend the range of missiles and to enable the design and development of smaller missiles with equivalent power and range that are cheaper to produce. The company also believes its product will have similar benefits for the space industry, making it possible to launch bigger payloads more cost-effectively.In addition to the funding, Adranos just recently hired Stefan Coburn as VP of Business Development and Strategy. Coburn previously worked at Blue Origin  in business development and government sales, and joins Adranos to lead the company;s commercialization of ALITEC.Adranos successfully tested a prototype rocket powered by its ALITEC propellant last year, and was the winner of the first-ever xTechSearch competition run by the U.S. Army.",https://tcrn.ch/2HghFPY
1944771,2020-02-11T07:00:40,"Negotiatus, looking to help businesses optimize purchasing, raises $10 million","Negotiatus, a SaaS business meant to optimize and streamline the purchasing and procurement process for businesses, has today announced the close of a $10 million Series A round.The funding was led by Rally Ventures,  with participation from ERA, 645 Ventures, Green Visor Capital and Stage 2 Capital. This brings the company;s total funding to nearly $20 million.Negotiatus  was founded by Zach Garippa and Tom Jaklitsch with an idea to detangle the process of purchasing supplies for a business. Garippa told TechCrunch that most solutions to this problem focus on one piece of the puzzle, serving finance or operations or the purchasers themselves, but ultimately making the process more difficult for the other functions in the business.Negotiatus pulls all of those stakeholders into a single platform where they can shop, place orders, track delivery information and manage spend all from one place.For example, finance departments often have to manually review and remit payment for thousands of invoices a month, normally across at least several vendors and various formats. Negotiatus allows the finance department to view all of that in a weekly or monthly invoice.Before Negotiatus, purchasers had to cross-reference approved brands, vendors and products each time they needed a new set of pens or toilet paper, jumping from one website to another and tracking shipments across multiple websites. Negotiatus scrapes your past purchase history to show purchasers what they want in a single place. And, of course, users can track those products directly from the Negotiatus dashboard.Operations can centralize order requests and approvals within the Negotiatus platform, and leverage analytics provided by the company to make better purchasing decisions. Negotiatus scrapes the SKUs themselves, across vendors, to make sure that businesses are making the smartest possible decision with their budget.The company says that it takes less than a day to get going on the platform.Negotiatus generates revenue in two ways. The first is a regular subscription model that charges on a monthly basis for each location on the platform. The second is based on spend volume on the platform (which comes from the vendor side).Thus far, Negotiatus has 300 customers, with a particular popularity among health and wellness businesses (SoulCycle, Orangetheory, CorePower Yoga) and co-working businesses (WeWork, Zeus, Domio). The company hopes to soon expand beyond physical products into software services.",https://tcrn.ch/31K6Zm8

Today, Randori, a Boston-based security startup, introduced Randori Attack Platform, which effectively packages the Red Team concept as a service.The company emerged last fall with a tool called Randori Recon, which helps find vulnerabilities in your network. As co-founder and CEO Brian Hazzard put it, the first product enabled customers to see their environment through the lens of an attacker.The next logical step is today;s announcement around Randori  Attack Platform. ;This enables them to launch real attacks, real exploits against their production assets with real attack tooling to find out what really matters and what doesn;t,; Hazzard told TechCrunch. What Randori Attack essentially does is give customers a safe adversary to play with, what he calls ;a legitimate sparring partner to ultimately touch and strengthen their defenses.;CTO and co-founder David Wolpoff used to run a consulting firm that ran Red Team attacks for clients. He says while this was a reasonable approach at the time, it took a tremendous number of people and tooling to pull off, and that meant it was expensive. The idea behind Randori Attack is to provide that kind of safe battleground for companies to test their defenses, but to package it in a way that puts it in reach of many more companies than the consulting approach.;We;re still capturing human innovations, and we;re still letting our customers control authorization. We;re still building professional-grade tools that aren;t intended to harm, but are intended to progress the attacker environment. And so you can have this sparring experience where you can also benefit from the economic economies of scale of our platform,; Wolpoff explained.The economies of scale come into play because as Randori learns about different attack techniques, it can build these into the platform and everyone who uses the platform will benefit. ;If we encounter something new in one customer environment that gets flagged by our research team, then they can develop a new technique and quickly automate that in a way that the new attack or vulnerability is leveraged against all of our customers,; he said.Randori Attack is available starting today.Randori Recon acts like a hacker to reveal your weaknesses",https://tcrn.ch/37ep8tr
1944582,2020-02-11T05:00:00,Meet 500 Startups; 26th batch of startups,"Following TechCrunch;s coverage of 500 Startups; 25th batch (and numbers 24, 23, 22, and 21, in case you wanted to go back in time), today we;re saying hello to the accelerator;s 26th cohort.500 Startups,  in case you weren;t aware, is a seed-stage accelerator and a collection of venture funds. The group, now with a few dozen accelerator batches under its belt, has several thousand companies in its universe. 500;s 26th cohort contains 29 companies, including a handful that we;d already heard of (Juked.gg, to pick one).Data, diversityBefore we get to the startups themselves, a few notes. To get a handle on the companies included in the batch, TechCrunch spoke with Aaron Blumenthal, a venture partner at the firm. After sharing a number of batch metrics with TechCrunch, we pressed for a bit more detail on the makeup of the startups in the group.Here;s a hybrid of our notes, and his details (condensed and edited for clarity), on the batch that the venture partner called ;another rung on the ladder of our diversity and inclusion state of mind;:37 percent of the startups are international. According to Blumenthal, ;this particular batch from the ;outside United States perspective; is a little bit smaller ; we usually see north of 50% outside the United States.;30 percent of the companies; founding teams include a woman. TechCrunch asked Blumenthal if that number was up, flat or down, to which he responded that 500;s ;average is usually in the mid 30s or so. Our last batch, for example, was 26% female. And this one is more [in] that direction which, of course, we are a fan of.;70 percent of the founding teams of the batch ;have one or more founders who identify as a racial minority,; according to the firm.It would be interesting to see a more granular breakdown for future cohorts, but the information provided was more than I expected and the numbers a bit better. And on the subject of numbers, Crunchbase has recorded 215 exits for 500 Startups. From its accelerator, 500 cites TalkDesk and Shippo as highlights.Turning to mechanics, 500 Startups invests $150,000 apiece into its accelerator companies for 6% of their equity, and charges a $37,500 for the program itself. So, in effect, it;s a bit less capital for the same ownership percentage.What else? Just that we;re walking into demo day season. 500 Startups will host the showcase for its 26th batch on March 19. Y Combinator  will hold its own on March 23 and 24. The Techstars website defeated my hunt for its next demo day, but in the name of fairness, it;s probably hosting one around the same time somewhere in the world.Here;s the list of companies in batch 26, with small notes from 500 on what they do:Acadium: Connects business owners and marketing professionals with aspiring digital marketers.Alloy Card: Offers a consumer credit card with automation that gives people more control over their finances while saving time.Amixr: Incident management software that helps engineering teams around the world optimize their workflow while minimizing hassles.AppBind: Lets partners buy and resell online software subscriptions as easily as licensed software, by bringing B2B SaaS into the global reseller market of implementation consultants, system integrators and distributors.Bliinx: Offers an easy and fast way to find information on business relationships by aggregating all interactions with contacts into Office 365.Briza: Provides an insurance-as-a-service API that enables instant quoting, binding and issuance of commercial insurance policies.Butlr: Empowers businesses to make data-driven decisions using artificial intelligence and real-time behavior analytics.CENOS: Easy-to-use simulation software that allows engineers to iterate designs faster than physical prototypes for induction heating and antenna design, among others.Connected Analytics: Nigeria-based company helping businesses and banks integrate data analytics and rewards in order to retain customers and increase revenue.Fakespot: Eliminates misinformation and deceptive content on e-commerce sites for consumers, brands and platforms.GamerzClass: Offers exclusive esports masterclasses with professionals to shape the future of gaming.Get on Board: Recruitment platform that connects global companies with the best Latin American tech talent.Juked: Aggregates information on esports games, including live streams, player profiles, scores and calendars to make esports easier to watch and to promote engagement.Kyndoo: Helps advertisers weed out fraudulent social media influencers, and provides data around their authenticity and performance.Mero Technologies: Retrofits commercial buildings with sensors to analyze in real time traffic and consumables, such as toilet paper and soap, to inform cleaning routes.Omnitron Sensors: Enables full autonomy of self-driving cars and drones with novel silicon photonics processes for sensors in safety-critical systems.Pilota:  Applies machine learning to predict flight disruptions for passengers and automatically re-books a traveler;s flight for free.Plant an App: Gives IT teams the speed of low-code development without compromising flexibility.Pluto: Customizes sleep pillows at scale based on the user’s body stats, such as height, neck-to-shoulder ratio and sleep preferences in order to optimize sleep.Predina: Applies AI to predict the risk of vehicle crashes for insurance and safety purposes, by analyzing more than 14 million historical crashes and other factors, such as street intersections, weather conditions and time.Renetec: Enables the creation of GUIs for embedded systems with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which reduces development time and costs.ShardSecure: Enables enterprises to securely move and store sensitive information to the cloud.Shiplyst: India-based ocean freight procurement marketplace that reduces costs for exporters and importers and gives them greater visibility into their shipments.Silk + Sonder: Provides a women;s mental wellness subscription service that makes daily self-help more personalized through journaling and peer-to-peer support.Sira Medical: Helps clinicians plan surgeries more efficiently through augmented reality, by providing them with high-fidelity 3D holograms of CT scans and MRIs.The Atlas: An online community of city officials crowdsourcing ideas that is modernizing the $1.6 trillion local government market.Thematic: Matches content creators who need great songs for their videos with music artists who need influencer marketing.Trash Warrior: Offers on-demand junk removal services for businesses. Customers can book services online for affordable pricing and reliable quality.Userpilot: Helps software product managers personalize the in-app experience across the user journey at scale.Living in the unicorn era as we have now for some time, it;s easy to lose track of the earliest stages of startup investment. But accelerators do have a history of helping birth some impressive companies, so it;s worth paying attention. More when we get to the various demo days.",https://tcrn.ch/2UKexns
1944726,2020-02-11T01:30:29,MoEngage lands $25M for its mobile-first customer engagement platform,"MoEngage,  a San Francisco and Bangalore-based startup that helps firms better understand their customers and improve their engagement, has raised $25 million in a new financing round as it looks to grow its network in North America and Europe.The Series C was led by Eight Roads Ventures . F-Prime Capital, Matrix Partners India and Ventureast also participated in the round. The six-year-old startup, which is an Alchemist alum, has raised about $40 million to date.MoEngage offers a product that allows clients to gain deeper insights into the way their customers or users are engaging with their apps and websites. “We can, for instance, tell at what time a customer is using the app,” said Raviteja Dodda, founder and chief executive of MoEngage, in an interview with TechCrunch.These insights, all displayed on one dashboard, could be very useful for firms to retain their existing customers or find optimized ways to attempt to sell more to them.“Based on your understanding about the customer, you can send them personalized notifications. Say you’re using a ride-hailing app. The firm would now know how often you use their app and at what time you tend to avail their service. Based on these learnings, they can offer you deals or reminders that could help them improve their conversion rate,” he said.MoEngage today works with a number of major firms in North America, Europe and Asia. Some of its clients include Deutsche Telekom,  CIMB Bank, Travelodge, Samsung, McAfee,  Vodafone, retail chain Future Retail, ride-hailing service Ola, budget-hotel operator OYO, grocery delivery startup Bigbasket and music streaming service Gaana.In total, Dodda said his startup has amassed “hundreds of clients” in over 35 countries and is serving more than 400 million active users for them each month.“MoEngage, with its differentiated offering, scalable platform and a customer-first approach, will play an important role in enabling us to deliver contextual and relevant communications to our customers and drive higher customer lifetime value,” said Arun Srinivas, chief operating officer at Indian ride-hailing startup Ola,  in a statement.MoEngage, which competes with a handful of startups including India-based Clevertap, will infuse the fresh capital to find more customers in North America and Europe, and scale its product operations, said Dodda.“What differentiates MoEngage from other engagement platforms is the combination of their ever-evolving AI-enabled customer journey capabilities, industry-best channel reachability and top-notch customer support. We are thrilled to partner with Raviteja and his team as they look to expand globally,” said Shweta Bhatia, Partner at Eight Roads Ventures.",https://tcrn.ch/2vjjVDB
1944113,2020-02-10T23:00:07,Revolut uses ;open banking; to let you aggregate other bank account data within its app,"Revolut, the European banking and money transfer app that now claims over 10 million customers, has partnered with open banking API provider TrueLayer to add bank account aggregation features to its app.The new functionality means that Revolut;s  U.K. customers ; both consumer and business ; can now connect their external U.K. bank accounts to Revolut, enabling them to see all of their bank balances and transactions, regardless of which of their U.K. bank accounts the data resides in. Known as account aggregation, the feature is designed provide a more complete view of your spending and other transactions, and it was one of the early promises of open banking.However, despite being adopted by legacy banking apps, such as Barclays, along with a plethora of money management apps, the aggregation use case hasn;t exactly seeped into the consciousness of most consumers. Revolut;s move to roll out aggregation features has the potential to help change that. Or so says TrueLayer co-founder and CEO Francesco Simoneschi.;I think this is the moment Open Banking will go mainstream,; he tells me, perhaps a little over optimistically. ;Revolut is putting this feature at the very core of their customer journey and will set the standard for the next phase — not just in the U.K. but everywhere.;“With the launch of our new Open Banking feature, U.K, customers can now view and manage multiple external bank accounts, enabling them to interpret their day to day spending across all of their accounts,; adds Joshua Fernandes, Product Owner for Open Banking at Revolut. ;We’re delighted to see that new legislation such as Open Banking is changing our financial landscape for the better, and I’m proud that Revolut and TrueLayer are at the forefront of this experience;.From a regulatory point of view, Revolut is authorised as an ;Account Information Service Provider; (AISP) by the U.K. regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. This permits it to access official U.K. Open Banking APIs for information purposes on behalf of customers.What it doesn;t allow is Revolut to transfer funds and make payments via third-party bank accounts, which would require a different Open Banking license. Were this to happen it would make it even more convenient to add and withdraw funds from Revolut and use the app;s budgeting and money transfer features, so I wouldn;t be surprised to see that come next.",https://tcrn.ch/2w0cam6
1944393,2020-02-10T16:00:47,Impala raises $20 million to build the API of the hotel industry,"Impala has raised another round of funding just a few months after raising an $11 million Series A round. This time, the startup is raising a $20 million Series B round led by Lakestar. Latitude Ventures is also participating in the round.The company is building a service that works pretty much like Plaid, but for hotel rooms. The hotel industry relies on old-school “property management systems” to manage rooms, room types, pricing, extras, taxes, etc.Instead of asking hotels to switch to an entirely different property management system, the company is upgrading those systems with a modern API. This way, you can build applications that query hotel data directly with a few lines of code. You get a standardized JSON response from the API.Impala  is currently compatible with a handful of property management systems. The company is still adding more systems in order to cover a wider range of hotels.Three hundred hotels are currently working with Impala, such as Accor hotels (Mercure) and Hyatt-branded hotels. The company currently has a backlog of 3,500 hotels. It really shows that the industry has been waiting for a product like this.While Impala is still focused on surfacing data in an easy-to-code manner, the company is already thinking beyond read-only data. The startup wants to let developers book rooms directly using the Impala API.It could open up hotel bookings to many other services. For instance, you could imagine being able to book rooms on Lonely Planet’s website. Services selling train tickets and flights could upsell you with hotel rooms.In order to offer rooms on the usual hotel booking services from Booking Holdings websites (Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, Kayak…) and Expedia Group websites (Expedia, Hotels.com, HomeAway, Trivago…), many hotels currently work with channel managers to send out information to multiple services at once. In the future, Impala could replace those channel managers with its API.Impala builds a single API for the entire hotel industry",https://tcrn.ch/2SgQevV
1944530,2020-02-10T14:57:25,What happened to Slack today,"You;ve been busy. I;ve been busy. But people are talking about Slack  all over Twitter, so let me catch us both up.All the ruckus concerning Slack and its publicly traded stock appeared to kick off with a Business Insider story, which had the following headline:Slack just scored its biggest customer deal ever, as IBM moves all 350,000 of its employees to the chat appGiven the context of the simmering Slack versus Teams battle, having Slack win what appeared to be a huge, new contract was big news. Slack;s shares shot higher, and the news engendered all sorts of headlines that now look a bit silly.Like this one:Slack may survive after all, after IBM choose [sic] them as exclusive supplier for 350,000 employees Slack shares traded up sharply all day. They were worth 15.4% more than yesterday, and then, all of a sudden this fine afternoon, trading of Slack;s equity was halted, pending news.SaaS kicks off 2020 with an extra billion in VC funding as round count halvesThis led to general chaos, with everyone trying to figure out what had happened. Had Google bought Slack? Had Slack bought a small poodle? Was IBM not a Slack customer? It wasn;t clear. Halting a stock, to be clear, is a big deal, and instantly brings attention to the company in question. Public firms don;t hold for news much, as it;s no good and no fun. It;s also why earnings come after hours.Later, Slack released an SEC filing, which included the fact that IBM was already one of its customers. This meant that IBM was not a new customer, and that the headline 350,000 employee figure would not manifest itself in that many novel seats of Slack sold.The company itself put a final bit of ironmongery in the human plasticware, saying the following in the filing to tamp down the market;s enthusiasm:IBM has been Slack;s largest customer for several years and has expanded its usage of Slack over that time. Slack is not updating its financial guidance for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 or for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020.Womp womp, I believe is the phrase.Also this happened, but the day;s events appear to be mostly a lot of whatnot that wound up being not what we thought.When Slack finally did begin to float in after-hours trading, it quickly gave back about half of its gains. Slack shares are currently worth $24.56 in after-hours trading. They started the day worth around $23, and traded as high as the mid $27s.Now you know.",https://tcrn.ch/38ilZdk
1944287,2020-02-10T13:22:29,CurieMD is using telehealth to plug the menopause support gap,"U.S. femtech startup CurieMD is offering menopause diagnosis and treatment prescription via a telehealth platform — beginning in California, where it launched late last year.Founder Dr. Leslie Meserve  says the goal is to widen access to treatment and support services for mid-life women, spying a business opportunity in offering an auxiliary digital service targeting an area of women;s health which she says is often overlooked within standard health service provision and suffers from a lack of trained physicians.She also suggests there is a “unique fear” in the U.S. around the use of hormone therapy for treating the menopause that;s left an access gap in support services — blaming concerns sparked by misleading publicity attached to the 2003 Women;s Health Initiative study which implied a link with breast cancer.;The authors of the study released a press release prematurely that then became an overnight sensationalized story about hormone therapy causing breast cancer,; she explains. ;What they didn;t say was that in the estrogen-only arm of the trial there was actually a lower incidence of breast cancer. So that was never stated anywhere. The other thing they failed to state was that the slight increased risk was not statistically significant; They did women a huge disservice by releasing this press release prematurely.;More than 15 years on, Meserve believes the time is right for telehealth services to help plug the information and support gap that still orbits menopause, in part as a consequence of ;deeply rooted; but misplaced fear of hormone therapy.Investment in products targeted women;s health and wellness has also been jumping up in recent years as VCs cotton on to an underinvested opportunity which more founders are also focusing on ; led by female entrepreneurs driving attention toward women;s issues.There are now a number of femtech startups specifically focused on menopause. Asked about competitors, Meserve points to several other U.S. startups ; including Gennev and Elektra Health.;There is a lot more interest in telehealth and I believe the time is absolutely right for more information to be given to the world; to make sure that women know that going through menopause is not the end of anything ; it;s the beginning of a wonderful second half of life,; she suggests, arguing that the regular healthcare services women are accessing often don;t have the time to dedicate to discussing menopausal symptoms and potential treatments with their patients.;Telehealth is not going to be appropriate for every single medical issue, that;s for sure, but the diagnosis and treatment of menopausal symptoms is really based on a discussion,; she says. ;We do let patients know that we are an adjunct to the regular care that they need to be receiving from their gynecologist and primary care physicians. But menopausal treatment requires a lot of discussion, a lot of talk therapy ; it;s a very cognitive diagnosis and treatment. And many OB-GYNs and primary care doctors really don;t have the time needed to explain the pros and cons of hormone therapy to their patients.;They do the physical. They address immediate, urgent needs, but they may not have the time to address something that doesn;t feel as urgent. Menopausal symptoms ; from insomnia to hot flushes ; they don;t feel as urgent to practitioners so I don;t think that they;re always given the time needed. And we know that physicians and other practitioners are very rushed. The way our insurance models go they have to see patients every nine to 15 minutes and sometimes a 15-minute office visit just isn;t enough to perform both a pap smear, a physical and answer all of these questions. So we;re an adjunct. We;re not in place of their regular physical exams ; we;re an addition to those.;Meserve practiced in primary care for close to two decades before moving into specializing in menopause services herself ; a shift that led to the idea of setting up a company to address mid-life women;s health issues via a web-based telehealth platform.;I;ve kind of grown up with my patients and a few years ago I was noticing that my patients were having lots of menopausal symptoms so I self-trained in the treatment of menopause and then became a certified menopause practitioner,; she tells TechCrunch, explaining her own transition from practicing in primary care to focusing on menopause care. ;I realized obviously I was only going to be able to see a very small number of patients and patients in my community. And I know that women across the country are suffering with these symptoms and they;re not able to find physicians that are comfortable talking about menopause and treating menopause. And so, through friends of friends, I was connected to another physician in our community, along with his friend who has expertise in startups and we had the idea [for the company].;;We know that there;s a lack of trained physicians in this area, we know that women want this relief ; they want symptom relief, they want to live wonderful lives,; she adds, saying the key idea is to use telehealth consultations and algorithmic triage to reach ;as many women as are wanting the treatment.;CurieMD  patients fill in an online quiz about themselves and their symptoms to get treatment suggestions ; which can include a prescription for an oral contraceptive or, in cases where there may be a risk associated with taking estrogen, an antidepressant for perimenopausal symptom relief; and a plant-based hormone therapy for menopausal women ; with the startup using an algorithm to help the telehealth practitioners offer the right treatment suggestions.;Based on the way that patients answer questions in our questionnaire they;re driven down a certain path to help our practitioners choose the right therapy,; she explains, noting that they;re not using AI to drive recommendations. Rather, patients; responses are used to determine which additional questions they get asked to pull out other relevant information ; in a classic decision tree algorithm.;The first thing we have to determine is whether they;re in perimenopause or menopause,; she says, discussing the decision flow. ;So in perimenopause their cycles are fluctuating, their ovaries are coming in and out of retirement. That happens in their 40s. And women start to have perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms at that time ; many of them do. So they;ll be having hot flushes, night sweats, irritability, mood symptoms. But the treatment for perimenopause is different from menopause. Perimenopausal patients can be treated very effectively with low-dose oral contraceptive pills ; so one of the algorithm;s branches is, first of all, are you in menopause or perimenopause?;And then for menopausal patients they have the option of choosing bioidentical hormone therapy. And if they have had a hysterectomy they only need estrogen ; and so they would go down the pathway asking about their estrogen needs. And then if they still have a uterus they will need both estrogen and progesterone. So then they have the choice of what type of estrogen they want to choose ; whether they want oral estrogen or estrogen delivered through the skin, which is a patch.;In cases where a woman is having vasomotor symptoms such as insomnia and hot flushes but has had breast cancer or where there;s another contra-indication to estrogen (such as having previously had a blood clot), CurieMD;s platform may prescribe an antidepressant to treat her symptoms.;They are candidates for an antidepressant called Venlafaxine [that;s] very effective for treating vasomotor symptoms in all patients ; but we use it mostly for women who are unable to take estrogen,; says Meserve.For now the platform has just three doctors performing remote consultations for the ;dozens; of early sign-ups it;s seen so far — with a third-party company supplying the trained physicians that are conducting the remote consultations.;We;re working with a large, national company that hires physicians who have chosen to provide telehealth,; she says. ;They;re board certified and we provide additional training in women;s health for them ; especially in the medications; that we offer.;Per Meserve CurieMD applies ;narrower; prescribing guidelines than an in-person physician might use ; exactly ;because it is a telehealth company.;She gives the example of a patient who has had a blood clot in the past ; where an in-person physician might be able to discuss with a patient;s haematologist and come up with a plan for them to be on a very low-dose estrogen patch. In this case, CurieMD;s remote service would not be able to offer such a joined-up approach to prescribing a treatment.;In telehealth we don;t know all the physicians in each patient;s community so we;re not going to be able to do co-ordinated care as well with specialist, outside of the box patients,; she says. ;So if they have any risk factors, such as a history of clotting, or of course if they have a history of breast cancer we;re not going to be able to treat those patients with hormone therapy. So if they really want hormone therapy that;s going to be an in-person visit with a physician.;Another exception would be patients who have migraines and who may want to be on an oral birth control pill. ;It depends on the type of migraines they have,; she says. ;So that;s beyond the scope of what we;re going to prescribe.;As part of the questionnaire process patients are also asked to rate the severity of their symptoms. Meserve says she;s confident this will enable it to not only demonstrate to individual patients the efficacy of the prescribed treatment but also enable it to present findings to the wider medical community ; with the aim of demonstrating ;the safety and efficacy of telehealth; for this particular use-case.;One of the things that I;d like to make sure that we;re doing is really convincing the medical community at large about the safety of telehealth in certain medical conditions,; she says. ;It;s not appropriate for every medical condition; There are certain things that need to have an in-person visit. But the medical community is starting to understand and adapt and trust telehealth ; but I think the more data that we have the more we;re going to be able to convince them that this is a nice adjunct to in-person visits.;;Patients are more accepting of [telehealth] than physicians are. Physicians are very conservative and very slow to change and so I feel that one of our missions is to present the data to physicians and help them understand that this is not a substitute for good in-person care, it;s just an addition,; she adds.The business model for the service is direct to patient ; which means CurieMD is not plugging into the U.S. insurance healthcare market. Rather, there;s a sign-up fee (currently waived), a per consultation fee and recurring subscription (taken via credit card) for any ongoing prescriptions which are shipped to patients by a mail-order pharmacy contracted for that piece of the service. (In an FAQ on its website, the startup claims its consultation fees ;are lower than that of most co-pays and our medication pricing is competitive with that of most pharmacies.;)The team has raised around $1 million in angel and VC investment to fund development of the business so far.Meserve says the plan is to scale nationwide, taking a state by state approach to building out coverage in order to get the necessary contracts and physician licences in place.;I would like to be in another 20 states by the end of this year,; she adds.In terms of differentiation versus the growing number of femtech startups that have also supported an opportunity to offer menopause-related treatment support, she says: ;We believe we;re the only one that contracts with a pharmacy and has the prescription delivered through a mail order service.;She also flags that the hormone therapy CurieMD;s service prescribes ; and delivers ;right to the door in discreet packaging; ; is a bioidentical plant-based ;FDA-approved; treatment, suggesting that;s another point of differentiation for its approach.",https://tcrn.ch/2SeAgSJ
1944354,2020-02-10T10:47:32,Facebook quietly acquired another UK AI startup and almost no one noticed,"Over the last few years, Facebook has been busy building out AI capabilities in areas like computer vision, natural language processing (NLP) and ‘deep learning,’ in part by acquiring promising startups in the space.Understandably, this has seen the U.S. social networking giant look to the U.K. for AI talent, including an acqui-hire of NLP startup Bloosbury AI in 2018, and most recently, acquiring Scape Technologies, a British company using computer vision to offer more accurate location positioning for augmented reality.Now TechCrunch has learned that a third U.K. acquisition quietly took place this December, seeing Facebook acquire Deeptide Ltd., the company behind Atlas ML, which is also the custodian of “Papers With Code,” the free and open resource for machine learning papers and code.A regulatory filing for Deeptide reveals that Facebook became a majority owner on 13th December 2019. The same day, Atlas ML co-founder Robert Stojnic published a Medium post titled “Papers with Code is joining Facebook AI,” which went largely unnoticed outside of the machine learning research community.Terms of the deal ; or even that the acquisition took place ; weren’t announced by Facebook at the time, beyond Stojnic’s sanctioned post. However, according to my sources within London’s tech community, the ballpark price is thought to have been around $40 million or thereabouts.Founded in 2018 by Stojnic and Ross Taylor, Atlas ML wanted to “make it easier to discover and apply deep learning research”. The young startup was an alumni of Entrepreneur First (EF) ; along with Bloomsbury and Scape ; and raised subsequent seed funding from Episode1 and Kindred Capital.I;ve contacted Facebook for comment and will update this post if and when I hear back.",https://tcrn.ch/3bBlUno
1944294,2020-02-10T10:02:14,"Localytics founders announce Demand Sage, a startup bringing marketing intelligence to small and mid-sized businesses","Just a couple days after mobile analytics and marketing company Localytics was acquired by Upland Software, two of its founders are announcing their new startup, Demand Sage.CEO Raj Aggarwal and CTO Henry Cipolla previously co-founded and served in the same roles at Localytics, and they founded Demand Sage with Chief Product Officer Randy Dailey — whom Aggarwal described as the ;perpetual all star; of the Localytics product team.Aggarwal explained that the idea for Demand Sage emerged from their time at Localytics, where the team worked with large enterprises and used customer data to ;refine their customer experience.; But he discovered that ;even for a mid-sized company like ourselves, it was impossible, infeasible to take advantage of those same capabilities.;At least, it was impossible in the past, but Aggarwal said the landscape has changed in ways that allow Demand Sage to now bring ;the best of a large enterprise’s marketing intelligence capabilities to small and medium-sized companies,; (as he put it in a blog post introducing the company).First, there;s cost. Aggarwal told me that while a smaller business can;t afford the ;massive cost to cleanse and manipulate data,; many are now using online software that collects and structures the data for them, so Demand Sage can take advantage of that work.;The problem is that the enterprise solutions are built in a way that requires customization or data manipulation as the first step to really understand what that data is,; he said. ;That’s what makes it cost tens of thousands of dollars, often. That’s the first piece that we think we can eliminate immediately.;Second, there;s the fact that marketers are increasingly creating their reports in Google Sheets, because of its flexibility. And third, Aggarwal said that while ;the raw cost of computation has gone down,; the data remains ;pretty difficult to access and challenging for a non-data scientist to use it.;So Demand Sage was built to take advantage of and address these shifts. It initially plugs into HubSpot (with plans to integrate with other marketing platforms) and Google Sheets, automatically generating what Aggarwal said are ;spreadsheets that are well-formatted and well structured; to highlight trends and anomalies that are relevant to marketers, which can then be used for ;communicating those insights back into organizations.;To be clear, we’re not talking about basic analytics data, but rather more nuanced analysis, the kind of thing that Dailey said smaller businesses struggled with in the past.;We might ask them what factors influenced customer converting down the funnel, and they would say we don;t do that analysis,; Dailey said. ;They often just left it on the cutting room floor.;As for whether Demand Sage can perform this kind of analysis across different industries, Cipolla added, ;Because the data is coming from a really opinionated API, typical data science tasks like anomaly detection and basic predictions should work for any industry.;Boston-based Localytics, a mobile engagement platform, acquires Berlin;s Tapglue",https://tcrn.ch/38gkk8b
1944260,2020-02-10T09:55:43,Facebook Workplace co-founder launches downtime fire alarm Kintaba,";It’s an open secret that every company is on fire,; says Kintaba co-founder John Egan. ;At any given moment something is going horribly wrong in a way that it has never gone wrong before.; Code failure downtimes, server outages and hack attacks plague engineering teams. Yet the tools for waking up the right employees, assembling a team to fix the problem and doing a post-mortem to assess how to prevent it from happening again can be as chaotic as the crisis itself.Text messages, Slack channels, task managers and Google Docs aren;t sufficient for actually learning from mistakes. Alerting systems like PagerDuty focus on the rapid response, but not the educational process in the aftermath. Finally, there;s a more holistic solution to incident response with today;s launch of Kintaba.The Kintaba team experienced these pains firsthand while working at Facebook after Egan and Zac Morris; Y Combinator-backed data transfer startup Caffeinated Mind was acqui-hired in 2012. Years later, when they tried to build a blockchain startup and the whole stack was constantly in flames, they longed for a better incident alert tool. So they built one themselves and named it after the Japanese art of Kintsugi, where gold is used to fill in cracked pottery, ;which teaches us to embrace the imperfect and to value the repaired,; Egan says.With today;s launch, Kintaba offers a clear dashboard where everyone in the company can see what major problems have cropped up, plus who;s responding and how. Kintaba;s live activity log and collaboration space for responders let them debate and analyze their mitigation moves. It integrates with Slack, and lets team members subscribe to different levels of alerts or search through issues with categorized hashtags.;The ability to turn catastrophes into opportunities is one of the biggest differentiating factors between successful and unsuccessful teams and companies,; says Egan. That;s why Kintaba doesn;t stop when your outage does.Kintaba Founders (from left): John Egan, Zac Morris and Cole PotrockyAs the fire gets contained, Kintaba provides a rich text editor connected to its dashboard for quickly constructing a post-mortem of what went wrong, why, what fixes were tried, what worked and how to safeguard systems for the future. Its automated scheduling assistant helps teams plan meetings to internalize the post-mortem.Kintaba;s well-pedigreed team and their approach to an unsexy but critical software-as-a-service attracted $2.25 million in funding led by New York;s FirstMark  Capital.;All these features add up to Kintaba taking away all the annoying administrative overhead and organization that comes with running a successful modern incident management practice,; says Egan, ;so you can focus on fixing the big issues and learning from the experience.;Egan, Morris and Cole Potrocky met while working at Facebook, which is known for spawning other enterprise productivity startups based on its top-notch internal tools. Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz built a task management system to reduce how many meetings he had to hold, then left to turn that into Asana, which filed to go public this week.The trio had been working on internal communication and engineering tools as well as the procedures for employing them. ;We saw firsthand working at companies like Facebook how powerful those practices can be and wanted to make them easier for anyone to implement without having to stitch a bunch of tools together,; Egan tells me. He stuck around to co-found Facebook;s enterprise collaboration suite Workplace while Potrocky built engineering architecture there and Morris became a mobile security lead at Uber.Like many blockchain projects, Kintaba;s predecessor, crypto collectibles wallet Vault, proved an engineering nightmare without clear product market fit. So the team ditched it and pivoted to build out the internal alerting tool they;d been tinkering with. That origin story sounds a lot like Slack;s, which began as a gaming company that pivoted to turn its internal chat tool into a business.So what;s the difference between Kintaba and just using Slack and email or a monitoring tool like PagerDuty, Splunk;s VictorOps or Atlassian;s OpsGenie? Here;s how Egan breaks a site downtime situation handled with Kintaba:You’re on call and your pager is blowing up because all your servers have stopped serving data. You’re overwhelmed and the root cause could be any of the multitude of systems sending you alerts. With Kintaba, you aren’t left to fend for yourself. You declare an incident with high severity and the system creates a collaborative space that automatically adds an experienced IMOC (incident manager on call) along with other relevant on calls. Kintaba also posts in a company-wide incident Slack channel. Now you can work together to solve the problem right inside the incident’s collaborative space or in Slack while simultaneously keeping stakeholders updated by directing them to the Kintaba incident page instead of sending out update emails. Interested parties can get quick info from the stickied comments and #tags. Once the incident is resolved, Kintaba helps you write a postmortem of what went wrong, how it was fixed, and what will be done to prevent it from happening. Kintaba then automatically distributes the postmortem and sets up an incident review on your calendar.Essentially, instead of having one employee panicking about what to do until the team struggles to coordinate across a bunch of fragmented messaging threads, a smoother incident reporting process and all the discussion happens in Kintaba. And if there;s a security breach that a non-engineer notices, they can launch a Kintaba alert and assemble the legal and PR team to help, too.Alternatively, Egan describes the downtime fiascoes he;d experience without Kintaba like this:The on call has to start waking up their management chain to try and figure out who needs to be involved. The team maybe throws a Slack channel together but since there’s no common high severity incident management system and so many teams are affected by the downtime, other teams are also throwing slack channels together, email threads are happening all over the place, and multiple groups of people are trying to solve the problem at once. Engineers begin stepping all over each other and sales teams start emailing managers demanding to know what’s happening. Once the problem is solved, no one thinks to write up a postmortem and even if they do it only gets distributed to a few people and isn’t saved outside that email chain. Managers blame each other and point fingers at people instead of taking a level headed approach to reviewing the process that led to the failure. In short: panic, thrash, and poor communication.While monitoring-apps like PagerDuty can do a good job of indicating there;s a problem, they;re weaker at the collaborative resolution and post-mortem process, and designed just for engineers rather than everyone, like Kintaba. Egan says, ;It;s kind of like comparing the difference between the warning lights on a piece of machinery and the big red emergency button on a factory floor. We’re the big red button . . . That also means you don’t have to rip out PagerDuty to use Kintaba,; since it can be the trigger that starts the Kintaba flow.Still, Kintaba will have to prove that it;s so much better than a shared Google Doc, an adequate replacement for monitoring solutions or a necessary add-on that companies should pay $12 per user per month. PagerDuty;s deeper technical focus helped it go public a year ago, though it has fallen about 60% since to a market cap of $1.75 billion. Still, customers like Dropbox, Zoom and Vodafone rely on its SMS incident alerts, while Kintaba;s integration with Slack might not be enough to rouse coders from their slumber when something catches fire.If Kintaba can succeed in incident resolution with today;s launch, the four-person team sees adjacent markets in task prioritization, knowledge sharing, observability and team collaboration, though those would pit it against some massive rivals. If it can;t, perhaps Slack or Microsoft Teams could be suitable soft landings for Kintaba, bringing more structured systems for dealing with major screw-ups to their communication platforms.When asked why he wanted to build a legacy atop software that might seem a bit boring on the surface, Egan concluded that, ;Companies using Kintaba should be learning faster than their competitors . . . Everyone deserves to work within a culture that grows stronger through failure.;",https://tcrn.ch/2H8MiXC

1943901,2020-02-09T09:28:40,"After $479M round on $12.4B valuation, Snowflake CEO says IPO is next step","Snowflake, the cloud-based data warehouse company, doesn;t tend to do small rounds. On Friday night, word leaked out about its latest mega round. This one was for $479 million on a $12.4 billion valuation. That;s triple the company;s previous $3.9 billion valuation from October 2018, and CEO Frank Slootman suggested that the company;s next finance event is likely an IPO.Dragoneer Investment Group led the round along with new investor Salesforce Ventures. Existing Snowflake  investors Altimeter Capital, ICONIQ Capital, Madrona Venture Group, Redpoint Ventures, Sequoia and Sutter Hill Ventures also participated. The new round brings the total raised to over $1.4 billion, according to PitchBook data.All of this investment begs the question when this company goes public. As you might expect, Slootman is keeping his cards close to the vest, but he acknowledges that is the next logical step for his organization.;I think the earliest that we could actually pull that trigger is probably early- to mid-summer timeframe. But whether we do that or not is a totally different question because we;re not in a hurry, and we;re not getting pressure from investors,; he said.He grants that the pressure is about allowing employees to get their equity out of the company, which can only happen once the company goes public. ;The only reason that there;s always a sense of pressure around this is because it;s important for employees, and I;m not minimizing that at all. That;s a legitimate thing. So, you know, it;s certainly a possibility in 2020 but it;s also a possibility the year thereafter. I don;t see it happening any later than that,; he said.The company;s most recent round prior to this was $450 million in October 2018. Slootman says that he absolutely didn;t need the money, but the capital was there, and the chance to forge a relationship with Salesforce also was key in their thinking in taking this funding.;At a high level, the relationship is really about allowing Salesforce data to be easily accessed inside Snowflake. Not that it;s impossible to do that today,  because there are lots of tools that will help you do that. But this relationship is about making that seamless and frictionless, which we find is really important,; Slootman said.Snowflake now has relationships with AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform, and has a broad content strategy to have as much quality data (like Salesforce) on the platform. Slootman says that this helps induce a network effect, while helping move data easily between major cloud platforms, a big concern as more companies adopt a multiple cloud vendor strategy.;One of the key distinguishing architectural aspects of Snowflake is that once you;re on our platform, it;s extremely easy to exchange data with other Snowflake users. That;s one of the key architectural underpinnings. So content strategy induces network effect which in turn causes more people, more data to land on the platform, and that serves our business model,; he said.Slootman says investors want to be part of his company because it;s solving some real data interchange pain points in the cloud market, and the company;s growth shows that in spite of its size, that continues to attract new customers at high rate.;We just closed off our previous fiscal year which ended last Friday, and our revenue grew at 174%. For the scale that we are, this by far the fastest growing company out there;. So, that;s not your average asset,; he said.The company has 3,400 active customers, which he defines as customers who were actively using the platform in the last month. He says that they have added 500 new customers alone in the last quarter.Snowflake scoops up another blizzard of cash with $450 million round",https://tcrn.ch/2UFq9YS

1943805,2020-02-08T02:30:27,"Facebook has acquired Scape Technologies, the London-based computer vision startup","Scape Technologies, the London-based computer vision startup working on location accuracy beyond the capabilities of GPS, has been acquired by Facebook, according to a regulatory filing.Full terms of the deal remain as yet unknown, although a Companies House update reveals that Facebook Inc. now has majority control of the company (more than 75%). However by looking at other filings, including a recent share issue, I understand the price could be about $40 million.Further filings show that Scape;s previous venture capital representatives have resigned from the Scape board and are replaced by two Facebook executives.Scape;s backers included Entrepreneur First (EF) ; the startup is an alumni of the company builder program ; along with LocalGlobe, Mosaic Ventures, and Fly Ventures.Noteworthy is that EF and Fly Ventures have both already had a joint exit to Facebook of sorts, when Bloomsbury AI was acqui-hired by the social networking behemoth (a story that I also broke).Founded in 2017, Scape Technologies was developing a “Visual Positioning Service” based on computer vision which lets developers build apps that require location accuracy far beyond the capabilities of GPS alone.The technology initially targeted augmented reality apps, but also had the potential to be used to power applications in mobility, logistics and robotics. More broadly, Scape wanted to enable any machine equipped with a camera to understand its surroundings.Scape CEO and co-founder Edward Miller previously described Scape’s “Vision Engine” as a large-scale mapping pipeline that creates 3D maps from ordinary images and video. Camera devices can then query the Vision Engine using the startup’s ;Visual Positioning Service; API to determine their exact location with far greater precision than GPS can ever provide. The Visual Positioning Service was made available to select developers via Scape’s SDK.Meanwhile the acquisition by Facebook, no matter what form it takes, looks like a good fit given the U.S. company;s investment in next generation platforms, including VR and AR. It is also another ; perhaps, worrying ; example of U.S. tech companies hoovering up U.K. machine learning and AI talent early.Update: A Facebook spokesperson provided the following statement: “We acquire smaller tech companies from time to time. We don’t always discuss our plans.”",https://tcrn.ch/2S8a7oE

SureSale is betting that its value-added services and better reporting standards can give dealers a competitive advantage versus online services like Carmax.Dealerships pay for the service, but in return their customers get a full inspection, a title and a background check alongside the five-month warranty.;Even though there have been a number of recent startups that have seen massive exits in this category like Carvana  ($13BN market cap) and Carmax ($16BN market cap), given that each company has less than 2% market share, any market this large is always ripe for continued efficiency gains,; wrote Upfront Ventures partner and SureSale director, Kobie Fuller,  in a blog post.",https://tcrn.ch/2H3hl7b

Casper,  joined by One Medical, carried over $870 million of private capital, venture and otherwise, across the finish line.Even though each IPO featured an unprofitable tech-enabled business that had posted sub-30% growth and gross margins under 50% (far more, in the case of One Medical),  they wound up miles apart in terms of their market reception and resulting valuation, measured in revenue multiples terms.So what can we learn from the two IPOs as we look ahead to other unicorn debuts in 2020? A great number of things that help set the stage for the rest of 2020;s IPO class. Let;s discuss three observations that stick out the most.Tech-enabled businesses can secure high-flying valuations in public offeringsThe surprise of the year so far has been the public market;s reaction to One Medical;s IPO.

1943031,2020-02-07T09:09:49,Our.News fights misinformation with a ;nutrition label; for news stories,"A startup called Our.News is working to make its users smarter consumers of the news.In other words, it;s confronting some big, seemingly intractable problems. For one thing, there;s a tremendous amount of disinformation online — as Our.News  founder and CEO Richard Zack put it, ;Unfortunately, you have thousands of people all over the world who intentionally make it hard for people to know what’s true.;At the same time, many people don;t trust the media and don;t trust fact-checkers. (Also, facts don;t actually change people;s minds.)All of this adds up to an environment where no one is quite sure what to believe, or they simply accept the stories that reinforce their existing beliefs.;You can’t fight misinformation by telling people what’s true, because they don’t believe it,; Zack said. His solution? Something that he described as a ;nutrition label for news.; ;It doesn’t tell you it;s good or bad, it doesn’t say buy it or don’t buy it, it leaves the buying decision in the hands of the consumers.;In some ways, the approach is similar to NewsGuard, which rates online news sources. In fact, Zack said, ;We really support NewsGuard and what they;re doing.; Still, he suggested that evaluating publishers isn;t enough, which is why Our.News provides labels for individual articles — he compared it to ;trying to choose between Lucky Charms and Cheerios,; where it;s not enough to know that both cereals are manufactured by General Mills.To put it another way, you don;t want to just accept what a publisher tells you. Even the best publisher can make mistakes, so you also want to understand what claims they;re making, what their sources are and whether those claims have been vetted by independent fact checkers.An Our.News label is accessible through Firefox and Chrome browser extensions, as well as an iOS app. The label includes publisher descriptions from Freedom Forum, along with bias ratings from AllSides; information about an article;s sources, author and editor; fact-checking information from sources like PolitiFact, Snopes and FactCheck.org; labels like ;clickbait; or ;satire;; and user ratings and reviews.Zack said Our.News has created around 600,000 labels to date, generating about 5,000 new ones every day. Of course, there;s still a good chance that the article you;re reading won;t have a label, but if that;s the case, Our.News might still be able to show you publisher information, and users can also click a button to add the article into the system.;We’ve intentionally combined objective facts [about the article] with subjective views,; Zack added. ;We think that’s the solution ; If you go purely subjective, then it;s just a popularity contest. If it;s just objective, then who;s the determiner of truth? We;re mixing the two together, condensing it all into the nutrition label, so news consumers can more quickly make their own decision.;He also acknowledged that different users will treat the labels in different ways. Some, for example, may still not trust the fact-checkers, but even then, Zack argued there;s still value in giving them a way to provide feedback to publishers in a way that;s more structured than a regular comments section.He also noted that user ratings will be weighted based on their interaction with the label — if you skip the publisher information, skip the sources and skip the fact-checking, then your rating won;t be worth as much as someone else who carefully considered all of that information.In addition to its current, consumer-focused distribution, Our.News just launched a way for publishers and other businesses to incorporate its labels. Zack said this could be used by ;news publishers, content aggregators, social networks, anywhere that’s displaying articles.; (This is also how he plans to make money.)The hope is that Our.News partners can use these labels to make readers more comfortable trusting their content, and to collect feedback from those readers. There will be some degree of customization available, but Zack emphasized that publishers won;t be able to change the actual content of the labels.Facebook;s fact-checkers toil on",https://tcrn.ch/2vh3ojb
1943556,2020-02-07T08:58:40,AssoConnect is a service that helps you manage your nonprofit organization,"Meet AssoConnect, a French startup that is building a software-as-a-service application to give you all the tools you need to manage your nonprofit organization (association in French).The company just raised a $7.7 million (€7 million) funding round with XAnge  and ISAI leading the round. Various business angels, such as Nicolas Macquin, Rodolphe Carle, Michaël Benabou, Thibaud Elzière and Phil Tesler are also participating in today’s funding round.Many nonprofit organizations use tools and services that aren’t really designed for this type of organization. Some manage members in an Excel spreadsheet, waste a ton of time with accounting tasks and leave money on the table by making it hard to accept donations and memberships.AssoConnect  combines multiple services in its web interface. First, it lets you centralize information about your members in a single database. It acts as a light CRM, and you can create multiple groups of members depending on what they do in the organization.Second, AssoConnect handles memberships and donations directly. You can create a form that interacts directly with your database to help new users join your organization. You also can create a donation module that can automatically generate tax forms. And you can create an online store if you’re selling goods.If you don’t have a website already, you can use AssoConnect’s template-based website builder. You also can create events and email your members from AssoConnect using Mailgun.Finally, the startup tries to generate accurate accounting reports based on donations, membership fees, ticket sales, etc. That’s why it makes sense to centralize everything through AssoConnect.The service offers a free tier for organizations with 30 members or fewer. But you’ll have to pay a monthly subscription fee if you have higher needs. It’s a tough sell, given that nonprofit organizations usually don’t have a ton of money to spend on tools and services.But the company has managed to convince 10,000 French organizations to switch to AssoConnect so far. Up next, AssoConnect wants to hire 80 people in 2020 and launch its service in the U.S.",https://tcrn.ch/39gcyez

Data says there are only two seasons for fundraising and one secret window							Fundraising is the single most important thing you can do for your business, but I know very few founders who enjoy the process.It’s inherently stressful: you’re running out of capital, which is why you’re trying to get more of it. There’s also no clear roadmap to getting funding and almost every company goes through the process differently. I’ve talked a lot about what makes a successful early-stage pitch deck and what you can expect when you’re trying to close a funding round. But do those same best practices still apply when you’re fundraising outside of the United States?Before we continue, the research project that we’ve completed is opt-in, and we don’t look at anyone’s data without their express permission. We take privacy very seriously, but we also work with an amazing group of founders who are willing to pass on what they’ve learned to the next generation of founders going through the process. If you want to be included in our next round of research, you can find the survey links at the bottom of this blog post.So what can you expect while sending your pitch deck out to European VCs?Have a 9-12 month runwayWhen DocSend conducted this study previously, we found that the average length of a Series seed or pre-seed was about 11-15 weeks. In fact, according to our research, if you’re in the United States and you’re sending your pitch deck to investors, you can expect about 50 percent of your views to come in just the first nine days. You’ll also hit 75 percent of your visits in just over a month, which is very much in line with the 11-15 week average window.However, when we look outside of the U.S., the numbers change dramatically.Sending out your pitch deck in Europe, you can expect to wait over two weeks (15 days) for the first 50 percent of your visits. And you’ll likely wait nearly two months (53 days) for 75 percent of your visits. There are a lot of reasons for the discrepancies. It could be that your potential investors are more spread out. We also don’t see the same level of urgency in EU funding rounds as we often see in the U.S. No matter the reason, you’re going to want to have enough runway to survive the fundraising gauntlet in your region. While I usually recommend having at least six months in the bank, you may want to look at having 9-12 months of runway so you’re not desperate by the end of your fundraising round.However, your round speed will most likely vary depending on the type of company you are. There has been a trend in recent years of U.S. investors looking to make deals with European startups. We also know American investors are looking for 100x companies to make solid returns for their funds. There are only so many 100x-type companies in the U.S you can invest in, but Europe is an emerging market. But American VCs have a different pace and rounds for hot startups can last weeks, not months. So if you think you have a unicorn in the making (and are comfortable with a more aggressive growth plan and the burn rate that goes with it), you can use U.S. investors to help create a sense of urgency. But even if that’s your plan, I would still recommend having a healthy runway to get you through in case the round doesn’t go as you expect.VCs are likely to spend more time on your deck — you should tooA clear indicator of VC interest is the amount of time they spend reading your deck before they request a meeting. Knowing how long they spend reading your deck and what pages they stop on (which isn’t necessarily a good thing) can help you gauge VC interest.We’ve seen an interesting trend in Europe over the last few years. The average amount of time VCs are spending reading a deck has increased and not by a small amount. We’ve seen an increase of more than 20 seconds between 2018 and now, even while the length of the standard fundraising deck has stayed stable. It’s still within the industry average (both in and outside of the U.S.) of 19-20 pages. With page length staying stable, that extra time on a deck means VCs are willing to spend more time assessing an investment.If you know your slides will be scrutinized, make sure you have content in each of the key sections VCs expect to see in your deck. Be very clear with the goal for each page and don’t include too much information. If your page is describing the problem your company is solving, you don’t need to add in your market size and the traction you’ve already gotten. Remember, the pitch deck is just there to get you the meeting; you don’t need to include every detail about your business. Your goal is to build an understandable narrative that will make a VC want to know more.You could face more competition for European VCs’ attentionInvestments are heating up outside of the U.S.With fund sizes increasing, especially in the earlier rounds, there’s more money being invested. But with the continual focus on unicorns, that money is being concentrated in fewer companies. In fact, in the U.S., we’ve seen the number of decks with six or more views drop by nearly a full percentage point from 2018 to 2019. But the trend is the opposite in Europe. The number of pitch decks that are being viewed six or more times is actually on the rise.We’ve also seen the number of pitch decks being viewed only once drop outside of the U.S. by 1.2 percent. This could be due to several factors. The number of VC firms in Europe viewing decks has grown by 56 percent on our platform in the last year. In the U.S., it’s only grown by 35 percent since 2018. Having more active VCs means there are more opportunities to pitch your company. But with a decrease in pitch decks that aren’t getting any action, it could be that the quality of startups is increasing, so VCs are saturated with opportunities. With well over 250 accelerators in Europe, it isn’t hard to imagine that with more and more resources available, startups are further along when looking for that initial investment than they were just a few years ago.TakeawaysRaising a funding round is completely different in Europe than it is in the U.S.Investors in Europe aren’t in a rush to view your deck, but when they do, they will likely spend more time reading it through and considering it. Combine that with the fact that the number of highly-viewed decks is increasing, and you have the makings for a long and potentially arduous round pitching to VCs who have multiple good investments on offer.If your business will support a more aggressive growth plan and investment, it may be worth it to court outside investment. But if you’d like to play it safe, aiming for a U.S. VC may be a waste of time.",https://tcrn.ch/386ljYw

First, we were back as a group in the San Francisco studio, which is always fun. Even better, we had NEA;s Rick Yang on hand to chat with Danny and Alex about the week. Yang, as old-school Equity listeners will recall, was on the show back in 2017. (Equity turns three soon, which is somewhat amazing.)All that aside, let;s talk about what we talked about. As always, we kicked off with three rounds:Sendoso raises $40 million on the back of 330% revenue growthFinix raises $35 million for its payments infra product with Sequoia as its new leadElodie Games picks up $5 million for cross-platform, in-house games (this sounds super cool)After that we chugged through a mountain of news. First up, the confirmation of a story that we mentioned on the show before, namely the existence of a new venture fund (angel pool, perhaps) from the CEO of email startup Superhuman Rahul Vora and Eventjoy founder Todd Goldberg. The $7 million vehicle is going to cut pre-seed sized checks ($75,000 to $200,000), which should make it a popular pit stop for pre-revenue companies.What next? Well, Casper of course. The company;s IPO pricing and debut was this week, something that we;ve had something to say about. That, and the latest from One Medical;s strong post-IPO performance, and the news that Asana has filed privately to go public in a direct listing.That last item was of particular interest, as the company hasn;t raised as much cash as other companies that we;ve seen direct list, the Spotifys and Slacks of the world. So has it raised capital that we haven;t heard about, or has it simply not spent the capital it has raised? If it had spent the money, then wouldn;t it want to raise some like with a traditional IPO? Mysteries! Riddles that will be solved when we get to see the damn filing.Oh, and Spotify continues to pour money into podcasting.

1943263,2020-02-07T05:00:10,Carta debuts fund to invest in startups that tap into its platform,"This morning Carta, a startup that helps private companies manage equity, announced it has created an investing vehicle called Carta  Ventures. The well-funded unicorn wants to invest in young startups that it sees building off of its data-driven perspective into the world of private companies, helping to foster an ecosystem around its core products and services.As TechCrunch has reported, the world of corporate venture capital has seen an enormous rise in the number of players active in the category, as cash-rich incumbents of all sizes deploy cash as a way to both keep an ear to the ground in their market and surrounding areas, and perhaps drive some cash-on-cash returns to boot. Companies like Slack have also compiled investing entities while private to put capital to work in companies that plug into their platform.With all the activity in corporate venture capital, why do we care about Carta Ventures? Mostly because Carta itself is of growing importance in the expanding and increasingly crucial world of private companies, and the company has some pretty specific things it;s looking to invest in.Why private companies matterCarta works with private companies to help with certain valuation varietals, cap tables and reporting. It also offers tools and services for the venture class. This puts it squarely in the middle of the private market, which is in the midst of a long crescendo.Investment into private companies is growing. The number of public companies is falling, and it;s taking longer for private companies to go public. The companies staying private are worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Hell, even The Economist dug into the private company boom, noting that ;[i]nstitutional investors are rushing headlong into private markets, especially into venture capital, private equity and private debt.;And Carta provides behind-the-scenes sinew and tissue to both the players (startups and other private companies) and their fuel (investors of all stripes). Efforts that sum to the startup working to expand the world of companies supporting those same firms through its new venture fund.Carta wants to accelerate (and even instigate, as we;ll see) companies that add to its own platform, making investing and participating in the private markets a bit more limpid and simple — two things that the world of private capital and its constituent bets have never had in abundance.Capital for whom?To get a grip on who Carta wants to fund and why, TechCrunch caught up with James McGillicuddy, who heads up strategy for the company. Starting with the basics, the capital that Carta Ventures plans to invest will come out of Carta;s own accounts. McGillicuddy said that the entity will invest ;balance sheet capital, with no outside structure,; meaning that the setup is ;very much from the corporate ventures playbook.;Standard so far, then. Next we wanted to know about how many general partners Carta Ventures would muster to go into the market. Instead of answering that directly, McGillicuddy discussed a number of existing internal staffers, and a collection of folks that he considers a ;pretty good group of folks in the classical sense on the investment committee that will be able to help these entrepreneurs and guide them towards a business that we think should exist now that we [are] programmatically opening up access to the markets.;Carta Ventures intends to write seed checks, according to a pre-release copy of a blog post shared with TechCrunch. McGillicuddy added that Carta Ventures; ;first priority is helping folks think through how to leverage our platform to build things that we think should exist, that we don;t have the expertise [in].;As you can tell from McGillicuddy;s last two answers, there is intentionality afoot at Carta Ventures in terms of what it wants to see built.In a blog post written by Carta CEO Henry Ward, three companies are mentioned: A startup focused on helping other companies come up with fair and market-fitting ;total compensation; for employees including both cash and stock; a startup focused on ;build[ing] analytic investment tools for venture as an asset class;; and one final startup focused on executing and publishing research on private companies.I was curious why Carta wouldn;t just build this out itself, given how precise its anticipation of what it wants to be built. McGillicuddy said that the best people for all things that Carta wants to see aren;t inside its offices (true), and that even if some of those folks were already working for Carta, his company has ;many other priorities and so many things to build.; Fair enough. But it indicates that Carta isn;t just building a corporate venture arm to go out and put money to work in companies that could later eat its lunch. Instead, it wants to put to use capital as a lever to power particular firms that could extend its reach.What else?Carta;s venture fund is willing to put money to work in idea-stage companies, provided that you;re doing stuff that it finds enticing (see above). And Carta is willing to put you up in its office and so forth. It;s there to help if you want it.Why is all this happening? Carta isn;t public and probably isn;t profitable. How can it afford to have its own venture arm? This is how:Carta was just valued at $1.7 billion by Andreessen Horowitz, in a deal some see as rich&nbsp;That was back in mid-2019 when it raised $300 million at a $1.7 billion valuation.When the private capital markets are wiling to throw that much money at you, why not put it to work funding smaller companies who may profit off of your private company platform?1If you say ;private companies; four times fast, you have to accept a check from Carta Ventures. It;s the rule.",https://tcrn.ch/2Saf68F
1943001,2020-02-06T20:58:53,Rideshare startup HopSkipDrive raises $22M to focus on school transportation,"It;s no secret that it;s hard to make the economics work at rideshare companies. That may explain the success to date of HopSkipDrive, a six-year-old, L.A.-based company that pairs drivers with both families but also, crucially, school districts. Specifically, the now 100-plus person company has deals in place with school districts in 13 markets across eight states where it works with more than 7,000 contractors.All contractors, says cofounder and CEO Joanna McFarland, must have at least five years of childcare experience before they are allowed to drive for the startup.Interestingly, McFarland says the school systems; most burning need is to ensure the safe arrival of both homeless and foster children, whose numbers in the U.S. have reached an astonishing 2.5 million and 440,000, respectively. On the heels of a brand-new funding round, we asked her what;s going on and why.TC: You;re just announcing $22 million in new venture backing, congratulations. I wonder if your story was harder to tell investors than it might have been a year ago, when they were more bullish on car-share companies.JM: We;ve never considered ourselves comparable to Uber or Lyft. We;re really caregivers on wheels, providing a very different service. We work with families, but we also contract with school districts and counties, and that has a strong path to profitability. We can predict supply and demand; we;re [enjoying] contracted revenue. It;s very different.TC: How do you describe the market opportunity?JM: U.S school districts spend $25 billion a year on transportation, yet only one-third of kids take a bus to school, so it;s expensive and inefficient and meanwhile districts are being asked to do more with less.Particularly challenging for them are children with specialized needs or homeless children who are moving around a lot but have the same right to get to school. It;s hard to re-route school buses, so we help schools with alternative transportation. Once we;ve contracted with them, we;re available, including to pick up a student who might be in foster care and moved to a new place at 10:30 at night. We can still pick them up the next morning.TC: There are thousands of homeless children attending San Francisco schools. Are you serving other markets where housing prices are forcing more families on to the streets? JM: Unfortunately, there;s a large and growing population in a lot of places. Districts might not even know how many students are homeless or in foster care because their situations can change so significantly throughout the year. It might start with 500 students at the beginning of the year and end with 1,000. Because it fluctuates so much, it puts a ton of demand on these transportation directors to figure it out.We;re partnered with L.A. County, for example, and it has the largest child welfare system in the country, with 88 districts and between 20,000 and 30,000 kids in foster care at any one time. It;s not a great statistic for L.A., but it;s the reality.TC: And it;s one driver, one child?JM: Sometimes there will be two or three kids. We can do carpools. If there are group homes, we;ll take them to their different schools.TC: What do your contracts look like then with these school districts?JM: We dictate the ride price, then it;s really on as as-needed basis. They pay for what they need. We talk with them about their needs last year and this year and that does help us tremendously with supply and demand.TC: How much of your business is coming from school partnerships versus from families that hire your company to take their kids to soccer games?JM: Our business for families is growing organically, there;s such a need for it, but 70 percent of our revenue comes from [school districts].TC: Your drivers are 1099 workers, so presumably they are working for other ride-share or other gig-economy companies? How busy can you keep them?JM: They are contractors. Because they must have five years of caregiving experience and because of the vetting we do, 90 percent of them are female,  and they love what they do because they;re driving in communities where their kids grew up and they;re tied to the mission of what we;re doing.We have some overlap with other gig companies, but with [HopSkipDrive] there;s safety on both sides of the platform, meaning they are driving kids, they aren;t driving late at night, they aren;t driving anyone who is drunk. They also have control over where they drive and when, based on personal preferences. They can choose some rides before school so they can take care of an elderly relative or grandchildren. They can see rides that are available up to a week in advance and select which ones they want depending on their schedule. Many are semi-retired and not looking for full-time income.TC: How can parents be certain their kids are safe?JM: We have a dual authentication process so drivers confirm a code word with the child and another piece of information that the child will know. Parents can track the rides in real time. We also have tech that monitors rides and can detect anomalies and provide support as needed. For example, they know via GPS and sensors if a driver is hitting traffic or has stopped owing to a flat tire and can react proactively, whether it is to send another car (in the case of a flat tire) or let the school and parents know that the child will be late. We designed the whole system for when a passenger may not have a phone.TC: Why start this company?JM: I started in finance then went into product management, working for tech companies. But as I was working, I was also growing my family, and I couldn;t get my son to karate at 3 o;clock. It was so frustrating. I didn;t need a nanny; I just needed to get him to karate.All the moms I knew had their own version of this transportation story. [At a school function] I suggested we put our money in a pot and hire a driver, and another mom said, ;How do we do that?; She;s one of my cofounders.Pictured above from left to right: HopSkipDrive cofounders Carolyn Yashari Becher.

1943194,2020-02-06T15:00:05,SoftBank-backed Fair puts the brakes on weekly car rentals for Uber drivers,"When Fair  laid off 40% of its staff in October, CEO Scott Painter promised it wasn’t shuttering leasing services to on-demand fleets. But just one week later, he stepped away from the role of CEO and was replaced by Adam Hieber, a CFA from Fair investor SoftBank. Today, according to two sources, Fair announced at an all-hands meeting that it would end its Fair Go program that helped Uber drivers lease cars on short-term (by the week) deals, as the company pushes for profitability. The program will cease in April. Uber  now confirms the news to TechCrunch, and now Fair has directly confirmed the news to us as well:Due to an unexpected increase in insurance premiums that would have significantly raised prices for Fair’s rideshare drivers, we will wind down our weekly rideshare service over the coming months,; a spokesperson said. ;We are working to minimize the disruption for Fair’s rideshare drivers, including notifying these customers of the status of their subscription in the coming weeks. We are working closely with Uber and exploring options with third parties to provide alternative customer mobility options to ensure a seamless transition for them, as well as continuity in Uber’s vehicle supply. We are thankful for our loyal Fair rideshare drivers and are disappointed we can no longer operate the business in a cost-effective way for our customers.Uber drivers who want to lease a car for a month or longer can still do so through Fair. The current program that is being wound down allowed Uber drivers to lease for increments of a week at a time. From what we understand, the program comprised as much as half of Fair;s business with Uber at its peak.Formerly valued at $1.2 billion after raising more than $2 billion in equity and debt financing from SoftBank, Fair laid off 40% of its staff in October. It had bought Uber’s XChange leasing program in early 2018. The deal lets drivers lease an Uber-eligible car with subscriptions to roadside assistance and maintenance for as low as $130 per week with a $500 start fee.But Uber sold the leasing program because it was unprofitable and adding to its losses at a tough time for the rideshare giant. As additional fees stacked up, Fair didn’t fare much better operating it.A source tells us Fair Go was profitable. It was an important focus for the company as it retooled its subscription services for traditional drivers. Another source says at one point Fair Go was adding about 250 to 300 car leases per day and had thousands of active leases.But Fair Go was facing higher insurance rates from carriers, which make sense, as Uber drivers can be on the road far, far longer than traditional car owners.Rather than trying to pass those fees along to drivers ; many of whom are already cash-strapped ; Fair told employees it would cease to lease to Uber drivers. That;s a respectable choice, as it could have pushed Uber drivers into debt if they didn;t fully comprehend what their total costs would be.Attempts to reach Fair for comment were complicated by many of its in-house PR team no longer being with the company. An agency representative provided the statement above after publishing time.Fair, the SoftBank-backed car subscription startup, lays off 40% of staff, sacks CFOAn Uber spokesperson confirmed the shut down of Fair Go, telling TechCrunch that ;Unlocking options for vehicle access so drivers can earn with Uber remains a top priority. We’re thankful for Fair’s collaboration, and their contributions to our vehicle rental program. We’re continuing to invest in rental partnerships, and building more flexibility beyond hourly, weekly, and monthly options available today.” Uber ; which continues to operate at a loss and is in no hurry to take on its own rental or leasing operations ; said it remains committed to offering rental options to drivers through partnerships with Hertz, Avis, ZipCar and Getaround, and they may be able to work with Uber drivers formerly renting from Fair.As for those who want longer-term leases, Painter said they could continue getting their vehicles via Fair in its ongoing Uber relationship.“As evidence of our prioritization on discipline and sustainable growth leading to profitability, we are exiting the weekly rental business,; he told TechCrunch. ;Fair remains committed to our partnership with Uber and to providing a flexible ownership alternative through our traditional month to month product, which is performing well and still represents the majority of our business.”Painter, who co-founded Fair with Georg Bauer and a number of others, took on the role of executive chairman of Fair.com when he stepped away from the CEO position at the end of October ; a role he remains in while Hieber sits in the CEO role on an interim basis.During the layoffs in October, Painter maintained that the action was proactive, and not in response to SoftBank  pressure.“SoftBank is a big shareholder and supporting my focus, and that is the reality right now,” Painter said at the time. “Leaning on us is not the term,” he added in response to our questions of whether SoftBank pressured it to make these changes. “They are supporting us — there is a big difference,” he stressed.The surprise CEO change one week later, and today;s news about Fair Go, points to a different unfolding of events that speaks to the pressure SoftBank itself is under.The news is the latest low point for the SoftBank portfolio in the wake of the WeWork implosion. That’s caused potential repeat LPs for SoftBank’s massive Vision Fund to tighten their purse strings and other late-stage investors to focus on sustainable unit economics.Heavily-capitalised, mature startups have been left scrambling to cut their burn rates, often through layoffs, and to shift business models in a push for profitability.SoftBank;s portfolio, which may have trouble raising on good terms after what many saw as inflated valuations propped up by the megafund, has been hit the hardest. This week TechCrunch broke the news that Flexport was laying off 3% of staff, or 50 employees.Other SoftBank-funded company layoffs include Zume Pizza (80% of staff laid off), Wag (80%), Getaround (25%), Rappi (6%) and Oyo (5%).And there may be more to come: Activist investor Elliott Management, which now owns more than $2.5 billion of SoftBank shares, has reportedly started talks with the company over a range of issues, including better corporate governance and more transparency and management around investments.Updated with confirmation from Fair, a further comment from Scott Painter, who was not ;removed; but stepped away from the CEO role, and a correction that Uber will continue offering car rentals through partners but not leasing as we originally printed. ",https://tcrn.ch/2OzSPP7
1942998,2020-02-06T11:00:02,AllVoices raises $3 million to build a platform for anonymous harassment and bias reporting,"As the national conversation pushes companies to reexamine the HR processes suppressing sexual harassment and bias reporting, tech startups are looking to find a way to smooth out the process and encourage communication.LA-based AllVoices is building an encrypted communications platform for offices that allows employees to anonymously send complaints to their human resources department that can then follow-up and track the cases in an easy-to-use dashboard. CEO Claire Schmidt tells TechCrunch that her company has just closed a $3 million seed round with funding from Crosscut, Greycroft, Halogen Ventures, Vitalize VC and others.CEO Claire SchmidtSchmidt, most recently a VP at 20th Century Fox, started AllVoices after finding inspiration in Susan Fowler;s Uber blog post to create a platform that allowed employees at companies to anonymously offer feedback and file reports about internal toxicity. Schmidt says existing processes used for reporting can leave victims of harassment hesitant to come forward and fearful of the risk of damaging their career paths.;We;re using this really outdated process, we;re basically telling people, ;Okay, just come in and tell someone in HR, and hope for the best,; ; Schmidt told TechCrunch in an interview. ;And to me that seemed especially unfair to the most vulnerable people in any given work environment because they;re junior, they don;t have as much job security ; they;re viewed as more expendable.;Employees at companies that use AllVoices can log into a mobile app and anonymously submit reports and receive text notifications when they;ve gotten a response from the company, a streamlined process that Schmidt hopes can encourage people to ;report in real time.; HR people don;t see names or any other identifying information and AllVoices doesn;t know the name of the employee either, with all communications being encrypted.;We do encrypt all of our data in storage, in backup, in transit, at rest ; at every level,; Schmidt says.Sixty days after a complaint is made, AllVoices sends a notification to the employee asking whether they were aware of any action being taken by the company and how satisfied they were with it. The startup then aggregates that data and provides it back to the company so they can get a clearer sense of their own responsiveness.AllVoices isn;t the only startup tackling this issue; in 2018 we profiled Spot, which is also building an anonymous reporting platform. AllVoices; platform goes beyond streamlining processes for sexual harassment; the startup has modules for general feedback, ethics and compliance issues, culture problems, diversity and inclusion concerns and harassment and bias complaints.The startup has also aimed to make a free version of its product so that employees at companies that haven;t integrated AllVoices can still make anonymous complaints by entering in an email for someone in their HR department. Schmidt hopes that the free service will serve their broader mission and help them onboard new customers.AllVoices says they now have nearly 50 companies using the platform, including Instacart, GoPro, Wieden+Kennedy, The Wing and FabFitFun.",https://tcrn.ch/3bmKHLV

1942649,2020-02-06T09:13:39,Nuro;s new delivery R2 bot gets the first driverless vehicle exemption from feds,"Nuro,  the autonomous delivery startup that raised $940 million in financing from SoftBank Vision Fund last year, is the first company to receive a driverless exemption from the federal government.The exemption granted by the the U.S. Department of Transportation;s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is for Nuro;s newest — and until Thursday, unseen — low-speed electric vehicle called the R2 that will be used for local delivery service for restaurants, grocery stores and other businesses. It;s a milestone for Nuro, as well as the autonomous vehicle industry, and signals how the federal government might regulate this technology.The R2 will soon join Nuro;s fleet of self-driving Prius vehicles in Houston, making deliveries to consumers on public roads, the company said. This deployment follows Nuro;s partnership in 2018 with Kroger to pilot a delivery service in Arizona. The pilot, which initially used Toyota Prius vehicles, transitioned to the R1 delivery bot.Nuro;s second-generation low-speed delivery vehicle was designed to be unmanned and operates exclusively using an automated driving system. Without a human driver, the vehicle doesn;t need some of the traditional and federally required features found in passenger cars, such as side-view mirrors or a transparent windshield.;Since this is a low-speed self-driving delivery vehicle, certain features that the Department traditionally required — such as mirrors and windshield for vehicles carrying drivers — no longer make sense,; U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine L. Chao said in a statement.The federal exemption allows the vehicle to operate without three features: side-view mirrors, windshield and a rear-view camera that shuts off when driving forward. This exemption is different from the one that GM is currently pursuing for its self-driving unit Cruise. That vehicle, which is not considered a low-speed vehicle, has a much longer list of exemptions.The process was lengthy, even for those three exemptions. Nuro has been working with NHTSA for three years and submitted its application for an exemption in October 2018.;What you have to prove is that even if the exemption is granted the vehicle will be at least as safe as other vehicles that are fully compliant,; Nuro;s chief policy and legal officer David Estrada said.The new R2 delivery bot has a more narrow vehicle profile and rounded contours where the side mirrors would otherwise be placed. This design feature will create additional room for bicyclists and other ;vulnerable road users,; Nuro said.The R2 is equipped with lidar, radar and cameras to give the ;driver; a 360-degree view of its surroundings. However, that required another exemption, Estrada explained. NHTSA;s exemption also allows the R2 to operate its rear-view cameras even as it moves forward. New passenger vehicles must have a backup camera that switches off once the human driver begins moving forward (to avoid distraction). Without a human on-board, those concerns are moot, Nuro argued. There are conditions to this exemption. Nuro has the exemption for two years on a conditional basis and is required to submit reports on the AV driving system and provide proper notice to communities where the R2 will be deployed. The exemption allows Nuro to produce and deploy no more than 5,000 R2 vehicles during the two-year exemption period.The R2, which was designed and assembled in the U.S. in partnership with Michigan-based Roush Enterprises, has a more durable custom vehicle body than its predecessor and a pedestrian-protecting front end that absorbs energy and can collapse inward to better protect those outside of the vehicle, according to the company.The vehicle also has redesigned doors and a larger exterior screen for customers to interact with the vehicle and unlock the storage compartments. It also has 65% more capacity than the R1 and its compartments  have temperature control to keep perishable goods fresh, including groceries or meals.",https://tcrn.ch/31xZtuD
1942894,2020-02-06T08:55:42,Snafu Records is a music label using algorithms to find its next big artist,"Snafu Records is bringing a new approach to finding musical talent — founder and CEO Ankit Desai described the Los Angeles-headquartered startup as ;the first full-service, AI-enabled record label.;It;s a world that Desai knows well, having spent the past five years working on digital and streaming strategy at Capitol Records and Universal Music Group. He argued that there;s still a vast pool of musical talent that the record labels are ill-equipped to tap into.;If there;s some girl in Indonesia whose music the world is dying to hear, they’re never going to get the chance,; he said. ;The bridge to connect her to the world doesn’t exist today. The music business is entrenched in a very old way of working, finding artists through word-of-mouth.;There are other companies like Chartmetric creating software to help the labels scout artists, but Desai said, ;I used to be the one buying the service. What always ended up happening was that we were trying to put 21st century technology into a 20th century machine.;The machine, in other words, is the record label itself. So he decided to create a label of his own — Snafu Records, which is officially launching today.The startup is also announcing that it has raised $2.9 million in seed funding led by TrueSight Ventures,  with participation from Day One Ventures, ABBA;s Agnetha Fältskog, Spotify;s John Bonten, William Morris; Samanta Hegedus Stewart, Soundboks founder Jesper Theil Thomsen, Headstart.io founder Nicholas Shekerdemian and others.Spotify expands personalization to its programmed playlistsThe Snafu approach, Desai said, uses technology ;to essentially turn everyone listening to music into a talent scout on our behalf.;The company;s algorithms are supposedly looking at around 150,000 tracks from unsigned artists each week on services like YouTube, Instagram and SoundCloud, and evaluating them based on listener engagement, listener sentiment and the music itself — Desai said the sweet spot is to be 70 or 75% similar to the songs on Spotify;s top 200 list, so that the music sounds like what;s already popular, while also doing just enough to ;break the mold.;This analysis is then translated into a score, which Snafu uses to go ;from this firehose of music, distill it down to 15 or 20 per week, and then the human [team] gets involved.;The goal is to sign musicians as Snafu artists, who then get access the company;s industry expertise (including advice from the label;s head of creative Carl Falk, who;s written songs for Madonna, One Direction and Nicki Minaj) and marketing support in exchange for a share of streaming revenue. Desai added that Snafu will share more of the revenue with artists and lock them in for shorter periods of time than a standard record contract.Asked whether streaming (as opposed to touring or merchandising) will provide enough money for Snafu to build a big business, Desai said, ;Economics-wise, streaming sometimes does get a bad rap sometimes. It;s a bit misunderstood — there’s still just as many artists making really, really good numbers through streaming, it’s just a different kind of artist.;And while Snafu is only officially launching today, it has already signed 16 artists, including the Little Rock-based duo Joan and the jazz musician Mishcatt, whose song ;Fade Away; has been streamed 5 million times in the five weeks since it was released.;There;s a major opportunity for Ankit and the Snafu team to build a new innovative and enduring music label at the intersection of technology and deep industry expertise,; said Hampus Monthan Nordenskjöld, founding partner at TrueSight Ventures, in a statement. ;The music industry is going through a tectonic shift and we;re extremely excited to work with Snafu as they redefine what it means to be a music label in the 21st century.;Spotify is buying The Ringer to boost its sports podcast content",https://tcrn.ch/2v8OQlN
1942335,2020-02-06T08:00:49,OptimoRoute raises $6.5M Series A to help businesses better plan their routes,"Route planning sounds like it;s a problem for big logistics companies like Amazon, FedEx and UPS, but in reality, it;s something every small business with more than a few mobile employees deals with. OptimoRoute, which today announced that it has raised a $6.5 million Series A round led by Prelude Ventures, is tackling exactly this problem. Built by a team of former Google and Yelp engineers, the service allows businesses to set their specific constraints and then automatically creates daily routes for their drivers, no matter whether they are doing deliveries or cleaning pools.What makes OptimiRoute stand out from some of its competitors in this space isn;t just its often significantly lower prices but also that it offers drivers and customers a mobile experience that includes live tracking and ETAs and the ability to change routes in real time as necessary. With OptimoRoute, companies can plan for specific days of the week or up to five weeks in advance. The company is also currently testing a pickup and delivery system for both passengers and goods, as well as support for multi-day long-haul routes.As the company;s co-founder and CEO Marin Šarić told me, route optimization is obviously a popular academic problem. ;On the one side, you do have these academic problems that are very proof of concept and minimalistic,; he said. ;And then, in the commercial space, you have software that is running ; in our estimation ; algorithms that have been well known in the previous century, literally, you know there;s even things from the 80s. [;] We at OptimoRoute really worry about the real-world constraints of what it means to build an effective schedule.;OptimoRoute takes into account a number of variables (how much material can fit into a van, hourly wages, skills needed to perform a certain repair, etc.) and lets companies choose different priorities for optimizing their routes.;We;re really focused on trying to make this technology available for everyone and this is appreciated even by very senior experienced logistics managers because they can focus on problems they;re trying to solve as opposed to working around hiccups with the software,; explained Šarić.Currently, OptimoRoute has about 800 customers that range from small businesses to large energy companies like Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, which manages the routes of more than 300 maintenance technicians with the help of the service. By reducing the mileage employees have to drive, users not only see increased productivity from their employees but, as Šarić noted, also reduce their overall carbon footprint.The team spent a lot of time on developing the basic algorithms that power the service. The team, though, expected that a lot of its users would be very sophisticated logistics managers, but it turned out that there was a lot of demand from small and medium businesses, too.;Prelude is excited to help OptimoRoute expand its reach and further develop its offerings for a multitude of mobile workforces,; said Victoria Beasley, partner, Prelude Ventures . ;We strongly believe that OptimoRoute is set to have a huge impact on the route optimization market, saving time, money and resources, while also reducing carbon footprint, for their many diverse clients.;",https://tcrn.ch/2OzC4nn
1942855,2020-02-06T08:00:39,Netskope hauls in another $340M investment on nearly $3B valuation,"Netskope has always focused its particular flavor of security on the cloud, and as more workloads have moved there, it has certainly worked in its favor. Today the company announced a $340 million investment on a valuation of nearly $3 billion.Sequoia Capital Global Equities led the round, but in a round this large, there were a bunch of other participating firms, including new investors Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and PSP Investments, along with existing investors Lightspeed Venture Partners, Accel, Base Partners, ICONIQ Capital, Sapphire Ventures, Geodesic Capital and Social Capital. Today;s investment brings the total raised to more than $740 million, according to Crunchbase data.As with so many large rounds recently, CEO Sanjay Beri said the company wasn;t necessarily looking for more capital, but when brand name investors came knocking, they decided to act. ;We did not necessarily need this level of capital but having a large balance sheet and a legendary set of investors like Sequoia, Lightspeed and Accel putting all their chips behind Netskope  for the long term to dominate the largest market in security is a very strong signal to the industry,; Beri said.From the start, Netskope has taken aim at cloud and mobile security, eschewing the traditional perimeter security that was still popular when the company launched in 2012. ;Legacy products based on traditional notions of perimeter security have gone obsolete and inhibit the needs of digital businesses. Today’s urgent requirement is security that is fast, delivered from the cloud, and provides real-time protection against network and data threats when cloud services, websites, and private apps are being accessed from anywhere, anytime, on any device,; he explained.When Netskope announced its $168.7 million round at the end of 2018, the company had a valuation over $1 billion at that time. Today, it announced it has almost tripled that number, with a valuation close to $3 billion. That;s a big leap in just two years, but it reports 80% year-over-year growth, and claims to be ;the fastest-growing company at scale in the fastest-growing areas of cybersecurity: secure access server edge (SASE) and cloud security,; according to Beri.The next natural step for a company at this stage of maturity would be to look to become a public company, but Beri wasn;t ready to commit to that just yet. ;An IPO is definitely a possible milestone in the journey, but it’s certainly not limited to that and we’re not in a rush and have no capital needs, so we’re not commenting on timing.;Netskope nabs Sift Security to enhance infrastructure cloud security",https://tcrn.ch/2GZsi9J
1942268,2020-02-06T08:00:09,Deepnote raises $3.8M to build a better data science platform,"Deepnote, a startup that offers data scientists an IDE-like collaborative online experience for building their machine learning models, today announced that it has raised a $3.8 million seed round led by Index Ventures and Accel, with participation from YC and Credo Ventures, as well as a number of angel investors, including OpenAI;s Greg Brockman, Figma;s Dylan Field, Elad Gil, Naval Ravikant, Daniel Gross and Lachy Groom.Built around standard Jupyter notebooks, Deepnote  wants to provide data scientists with a cloud-based platform that allows them to focus on their work by abstracting away all of the infrastructure. So instead of having to spend a few hours setting up their environment, a student in a data science class, for example, can simply come to Deepnote and get started.In its current form, Deepnote doesn;t charge for its service, despite the fact that it allows its users to work with large data sets and train their models on cloud-based machines with attached GPUs.As Deepnote co-founder and CEO (and ex-Mozilla engineer) Jakub Jurových told me, though, he believes that the most important feature of the service is its ability to allow users to collaborate. ;Over the past couple of years, I started to do a lot of data science work and helped a couple of companies scale up their data science teams,; he said. ;And again and again, we run into the same issue: people have real trouble collaborating.;Jurových argues that while it;s easy enough to keep two or three data scientists in sync, once you have a bigger team, you quickly run into issues because the current set of tools was never meant to do this kind of work. ;If I;m a data scientist by training, I spend most of my time doing math and stats,; he said. ;But then, expecting me to connect to an EC2 cluster and spin a bunch of GPU instances for parallel training is just not something I;m looking for.;When it started this project in early 2019, the Deepnote team decided to put Jupyter notebooks at the core of the user experience. That is, after all, what most data scientists are already familiar with. It then built the collaborative features around that, as well as tools for pulling in data from third-party services and scheduling tools for kicking off jobs inside of the platform at regular intervals.Deepnote is already quite popular with students. Jurových also noted that a lot of teachers already use Deepnote to publish interactive exercises for their students. Over time, the company obviously wants to bring more businesses on board, but for the time being, it is mostly focused on building its product. Given its collaborative nature, the team also believes that the service will naturally grow through word of mouth as people invite others to collaborate on products.“Data science is overdue for the benefits of tools that are cloud and collaboration native,; said Accel  partner Vas Natarajan. ;This is a fast-growing, dynamic market that;s demanding a successor to incumbent tools. Jakub and his team are building powerful software to modernize data science workflow for teams.;The new funding will mostly go into hiring and building out the product, with a focus on the overall user experience. Even within the data science community, there are a variety of use cases, after all, and an NLP engineer has different needs from a computer vision engineer.",https://tcrn.ch/2ugIMrw
1941663,2020-02-06T07:50:25,Why Astra built a space startup and rocket factory in Silicon Valley,"There;s a new launch startup in the mix called Astra, which has been operating in semi-stealth mode for the past three years, building its rockets just a stone;s throw from the heart of startup central in Alameda County, Calif. Astra;s  approach isn;t exactly a secret — its founders didn;t set out to hide anything and industry observers have followed its progress — but CEO Chris Kemp says he;s not particularly bothered about flying under the radar, so to speak.Yes, the company had a somewhat splashy mainstream public premiere via a Bloomberg Businessweek profile on Monday, but that was more by virtue of writer Ashlee Vance;s keen interest in the emerging space economy than a desire for publicity on the part of Kemp or his cohorts. In fact, the CEO admitted to me that were it not for Vance;s desire to expound on the company;s efforts and a forthcoming attempt at winning a $12 million DARPA prize for responsive rocketry, Astra would still be content to continue to operate essentially undercover.That;s just one way in which Astra differs from other space startups, which typically issue press releases and coordinate media events around each and every launch. Kemp, a former NASA CTO, and Adam London, an aerospace engineer who previously founded rocket miniaturization startup Ventions, designed their rocket startup from the ground up in a way that;s quite different from companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin  and Rocket Lab.;I;ve never been to one of our launches,; Kemp told me, referring to two test launches that Astra flew previously, both of which technically failed shortly into their flights. ;Because I don;t think the CEO, or frankly any of our employees, should be anywhere near the rocket when it launches; we should automate everything. As much as possible, let;s put the rockets where they need to launch from, which might be an island on the equator, and it might be way up north near the poles, but let;s not add cost by putting a huge spaceport with fixed fortification in a very expensive place where it;s very hard to get to.;",https://tcrn.ch/2Ur7EHH
1942815,2020-02-06T07:38:16,YC-backed Goodcover launches into the fast-moving insurtech space,"As the insuretech space fills up, a new entrant is joining the fight.Y Combinator -backed Goodcover is launching today to take on the likes of big insurance, as well as insurance startups like Lemonade, Jetty, Hippo and Zebra.The company offers renters insurance in California. The twist? Goodcover returns unclaimed premiums to policy holders at the end of the year.Here;s how it works. Goodcover operates as a managing general agent, which means they write the policy, set the pricing and build their own risk assessment model, but partner with insurance carriers to hold the back-end capital and write on their book. This differs from Lemonade, which is its own insurance carrier, but is similar to Hippo and many other new insurtech startups.The first priority of the company, according to co-founder and CEO Chris Lotz, is to use technology to bring down the cost of insurance in the first place. That means eliminating paperwork, sales agents and expensive acquisition tactics used by big insurance. Statista reports that GEICO, Progressive and State Farm alone spent upwards of $3 billion on advertising in 2018.But tech is also used to rethink the insurance model. Here;s what the company said in its launch blog post:Old models say the number one indicator you’ll make a claim is having a prior claim, and charge you accordingly, even when you were not at fault. Models designed with the Member in mind determine whether a claim is likely to reoccur, or whether mitigation has actually reduced risk and warrants a lower price. Good technology empowers us to build this new data into our models, keeping prices as low as possible for as many people as possible.Lotz says that USAA was actually a part of the inspiration for Goodcover. Lotz worked at AIG for eight years before starting the company, inspired by the USAA;s member-first mentality. Lotz looked to model Goodcover after USAA, the insurance co-operative for military service members and their families, which has no outside agents, pays a dividend and uses technology to both keep costs down and offer quality policy coverage.Goodcover takes a 20% cut up front. The other 80% goes to Goodcover;s partners: KnightBrook Insurance (primary carrier), Transatlantic Reinsurance (reinsurance), North American Risk Services (claims services) and Milliman (actuarial services).The majority of that 80% goes toward indemnity, or paying out claims, with some going toward loss adjustment expenses (paying the human that goes and checks out or works on the claim), carrier fees and reinsurance premiums. These portions of the revenue are where partners like KnightBrook and Transatlantic Reinsurance make their money.Whatever is left over is passed on to the policy holders. Lotz says that that number is expected to range from 5% to 10%. However, in a case where reinsurance premiums are applied (if, for example, a major earthquake were to destroy multiple Goodcover-insured apartment buildings), there may not be extra cash left over. In that case, Goodcover will take on the extra cost, eliminating the dividend to policy holders but also not costing them any extra.;This isn;t about charging everyone and then giving 50% back,; said Lotz. ;It;s a guarantee that we;re not overcharging you in the first place.; The company claims that it saves renters 45% on their renters insurance.Goodcover has raised a total of $2 million in funding from Fuel Capital, YC, Liquid 2, Box Group, several angels and Transatlantic Reinsurance, one of their insurance partners.The company has plans to continue expanding, though insurance is regulated at the state level, which could make that a more tedious process. Lotz explained that starting in California was very purposeful, as regulatory approval is relatively difficult to secure in such a consumer protection-heavy state. The company is also interested in introducing home owners insurance.Why VCs are dumping money into insurance marketplacesInsurance is a crowded market, with startups racing to rethink the model, employ tech to advance the product and update the value proposition for a millennial audience that may be new to insurance.

It also announced it has joined the Y Combinator Winter 20 cohort.Blumberg Capital and TLV Partners led the round with participation from Y Combinator . The company has now raised $11 million with the $3 million seed round announced in 2018.Since that seed round, company co-founder and CEO Shimon Tolts says that the company learned that while scanning code for issues was something DevOps teams found useful, they wanted help defining the rules. So Datree  has created a series of rules packages you can run against the code to find any gaps or issues.;We offer development best practices, coding standards and security and compliance policies. What happens today is that, as you connect to Datree, we connect to your source code and scan the entire code base, and we recommend development best practices based on your technology stack,; Tolts explained.He says that they build these rules packages based on the company;s own expertise, as well as getting help from the community, and in some cases partnering with experts. For its Docker security package, it teamed up with Aqua Security.The focus remains on applying these rules in GitHub where developers are working. Before committing the code, they can run the appropriate rules packages against it to ensure they are in compliance with best practices.Datree rules packages. Screenshot: DatreeTolts says they began looking at Y Combinator after the seed round because they wanted more guidance on building out the business. ;We knew that Y Combinator could really help us because our product is relevant to 95 percent of all YC companies, and the program has helped us go and work on six figure deals with more mature YC companies,; he said.Datree is working directly with Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, and he says being part of the Winter 20 cohort has helped him refine his go-to-market motion. He admits he is not a typical YC company having been around since 2017 with an existing product and 12 employees, but he thinks it will help propel the company in the long run.Datree gets $3M seed round to build DevOps policy engine in GitHub",https://tcrn.ch/395dCSC

Driver’s Seat, which participated in the first batch of the Start.coop accelerator, is one such example. Driver’s Seat is designed to help gig workers own and use their data so they can maximize their income. It works by requiring ride-hail drivers to install an app that educates them about how the co-op collects and uses their data. In exchange, the app gives them insights about their real hourly wages after expenses and how those wages relate to different driving strategies.For example, Driver’s Seat helps drivers determine when and where they should drive when it’s slow and can calculate the odds of making driver bonuses via Uber, Lyft and other ride-hail platforms. Driver’s Seat then aggregates all of the data to market it to cities, municipalities and state governments that require this information for planning purposes. “These folks are hungry to support ride-hail drivers and make ride-hailing work better in their cities,” Driver’s Seat founder and CEO Hays Witt tells TechCrunch.City agencies can use this data to make better decisions about transportation planning as it relates to congestion, pollution, curb allocation and affordable transit. The proceeds from those contracts then go back to the drivers via dividends. ",https://tcrn.ch/385NfvN

It brings total funding to date to $12.5 million and will be used to expand into new geographies including Australia and LATAM. The U.K. company also plans to launch new products for large retailers and invest in scaling its operations.Launched in early 2016, Moteefe provides an ;end-to-end; technology solution for entrepreneurs, influencers and (micro) retailers wanting to design, create and sell customised products, such as printed t-shirts or engraved jewellery. The platform enables brands to design merchandise and sell it via their own white-labelled Moteefe store or through their own site, app or other marketing channels.Put simply, you upload your design to the Moteefe site and the company takes care of printing, the store, payments, customer service and fulfillment globally. Moteefe then takes a small commission on sales. However, unlike some traditional marketplaces, users can launch their own store with their own domain, maintaining the customer relationship and data.;Launching and scaling a global e-commerce business is extremely complex and requires access to a wide variety of capabilities,; says co-founder and CEO Mathijs Eefting. ;We provide a complete end-to-end solution that takes care of everything from e-commerce sites and payments up to (on-demand) production, fulfillment, and support at global scale. Everyone can start and scale their own business globally within a matter of minutes, [with] no upfront costs or inventory risk;.Eefting says that at the heart of Moteefe;s offering is on-demand production. Typically referred to as Print-on-Demand (POD), the company works also with a range of other production methods via its network. ;Since POD is difficult to implement — it requires completely different back-end and front-end processes — we have built an interface that allows anyone to leverage the functionality and start building/growing their own retail brands around the world within minutes for free.;Moteefe has built its own proprietary production software that instantaneously centralises orders via merchant sites. It then routes those orders on a per-order basis directly into the production lines of its partners.;It takes into consideration end-consumer location, partner inventory levels, capacity, quality and costs,; explains Eefting. ;This enables us to deliver 10,000s of products on a daily basis anywhere in the world with a 1-2-day turnaround time.;On competitors, the Moteefe CEO reiterates that the company isn;t a marketplace like Teespring, Red Bubble, Zazzle, or Café Press, which he says are leveraged mainly by creatives and designers uploading their own artwork onto the marketplace, and earning a small commission when someone purchases a product with their design. ;They are not building a business, they’re simply monetising their creativity,; he explains.Instead, Eefting says Moteefe is empowering brands and companies to take advantage of global on-demand production. ;Our users own their brand, client relationship and marketing channels –- we provide the white label store and fulfillment technology,; he adds.",https://tcrn.ch/38flSiE
1942629,2020-02-05T16:05:22,Company-builder Antler passes $75M raised after investment from Schroders and Ferd,"Antler is a ;company builder; that emerged a couple of years ago, running startup generator programs and investing from an early stage, bringing a heady mix of technologists, product builders and operators together with its own technology stack.Now, plenty of ;company builders; have come and gone. It’s a bit like Apocalypse Now: everyone goes in thinking they will come up with the major formula to spit out startups at a prodigious rate and they come out screaming “The Horror! The Horror!”But Antler  appears to have been on an interesting run. It has made more than 120 investments across a wide range of companies, with several going on to raise later-stage funding from the likes of Sequoia, Golden Gate Ventures, East Ventures,  Venturra Capital and the Hustle Fund.Since its launch in Singapore two years ago, Antler now has a presence across New York, London, Singapore, Sydney, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Nairobi and Oslo.Today, it;s announcing it has attracted investment from British investment management company Schroders, investment house FinTech Collective and Ferd, the vehicle used by the Norwegian industrialist and investor Johan H. Andresen.This latest investment takes the capital raised by Antler over the past six months to more than $75 million.These investors join an existing group that includes Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, Canica International and Credit Saison, the third-largest credit card issuer in Japan. The idea here is that these investors get exposure to early-stage companies as they are built.As with most company builders and accelerators, Antler only takes 1-1.5% of the applicantsIts portfolio includes Sampingan, an on-demand workforce in Indonesia; Xailient, a computer vision technology; Airalo, a global e-sims marketplace; and FusedBone, which enables medical centers to produce bespoke, non-metal implants on-site.Magnus Grimeland, Antler co-founder and CEO said: “With our support, our founders start refining their ideas and building new and innovative businesses. What is equally important is the deep relationship our founders build with their peers, our advisors and backers. Having accomplished investors like Schroders, Ferd and FinTech Collective on board means we can provide a more valuable network for our startups as they grow their businesses.”Peter Harrison, Group CEO of Schroders, who will also be joining Antler’s advisory board, said: “We are in a period of unprecedented change. The visibility on venture capital activity and innovation that Antler provides is therefore leading edge.”Antler says more than 40 percent of its portfolio companies have a female co-founder and 78 percent of these have a female CEO.",https://tcrn.ch/3bgP22U
1942583,2020-02-05T15:12:50,"Whatnot wants to be the GOAT of collectible toys, starting with Funko Pops","Funko  Pops. You;ve probably noticed them at your local GameStop, Hot Topic or spread out all over your co-worker;s desk. These lil; vinyl figurines and their big ol; heads have taken over retail shelves in the last few years. You can now find a Funko Pop! (or thirty) for just about every fandom; there are more than 8,000 different Pops, and that number never seems to stop growing.Like most collectible things, some Pops are worth more than others — whether they;re obscure characters that didn;t get a big run, limited-edition color variations or were only sold for a day or two at a convention, the rarest Pops can sell for hundreds or thousands of dollars. And, like anything where people are dropping piles of cash, there are folks trying to sell fakes.Whatnot, a company out of Y Combinator;s Winter 2020 class, wants to tackle the issue of fakes in collectibles by adapting a model proven by services like GOAT and StockX: authenticated resale.As with the aforementioned, Whatnot  works as the obsessively-informed middle man between buyer and seller. Buyer makes an offer, seller sends their figurine to Whatnot, Whatnot uses its growing knowledge of what;s real (and how to flag what;s not) to make sure it;s legit. If everything looks good, Whatnot forwards the Funko Pop to the buyer and takes their cut (about 9%, plus a few bucks for shipping).;We started out buying and reselling sneakers, actually,; Whatnot co-founder Grant LaFontaine tells me. ;Then we started getting into buying/reselling Funko Pops. As we started to do this, we noticed it was much more difficult, and much more unsafe, to buy and sell Funko Pops than it was to buy and sell sneakers.;Services like GOAT and StockX had ;drastically simplified; the process for sneaker fans, LaFontaine says, helping to weed out counterfeits for buyers while limiting potential scams that could hurt sellers.Today all sales on Whatnot are verified by a human expert. That makes sense for the rarer, more expensive figurines. The ;Grails,; as Funko Pop collectors call them — like this Comic Con Sith Trooper that has been selling for around $600-700, or this 2012 ;Holographic; Darth Maul that can go for thousands. For the less rare stuff, though, it;s a bit overkill.With that in mind, Whatnot is building out its database of the red flags to look for with each transaction — things like boxes that are just slightly mis-sized, or a logo that doesn;t look quite right. In time, this could allow for more of their verification to be automated, with the human expert (and the associated higher fees) reserved for bigger transactions.Whatnot isn;t alone in noticing this market;s potential. StockX, the authenticated resale marketplace that first focused on sneakers, expanded into collectibles late last year. Whatnot is looking to find its fan base by focusing solely on collectibles, giving collectors the exact user experience, filters and info they;d be looking for within a given category.That;s not to say they;re focusing solely on Funko Pops, though — not in the long run, at least. The team intends to expand into other types of collectibles down the road, with Pokémon cards being the likely next candidate.Whatnot tells me it has raised a $550,000 pre-seed round from Wonder Ventures, YC, and a handful of angel investors.",https://tcrn.ch/2S2uxzn

1941819,2020-02-05T10:59:35,How Hoop hit #2 with its Tinder for Snapchat,"Snapchat;s developer platform is blowing up as a gateway to teen social app users. Hoop is the latest Snap Kit blockbuster, rocketing to No. 2 on the overall App Store charts this month with its Tinder -esque swiping interface for discovering people and asking to message with them over Snapchat. Within a week of going viral, unfunded French startup Dazz saw Hoop score 2.5 million downloads.The fact that such a dumbfoundingly simple and already ubiquitous style of app was able to climb the charts so fast demonstrates the potential of Snap Kit to drive user lock-in for Snapchat. Because the developer platform lets other apps piggyback on its login system and Bitmoji avatars, it creates new reasons for users to set up a Snapchat account and keep using it. It;s the same strategy that made Facebook an entrenched part of the internet, but this time it;s for a younger crowd.In the first-ever interview about Hoop, Dazz;s 26-year-old co-founders Lucas Gervais and Alexi Pourret reveal that the idea came from watching user patterns in their previous experiment on the Snap Kit platform. They built an app called Dazz in 2018 that let users create polls and get anonymous answers from friends, but they noticed their 250,000 users ;always ended up adding each other on Snap. So we decided to create Hoop, the app to make new Snap friends,; Gervais tells me.Gervais and Pourret have been friends since age two, growing up in small town in France. They met their two developers in high school, and are now marketing students at university. With Hoop, they say the goal was to ;meet everyone’s needs, from connecting people from different cultures to helping lonely people to feel better to simply growing your Snapchat community.;The Dazz / Hoop team (from left): Developers Julien Maire &amp; Teddy Vallar, co-founders Alexi Pourret &amp; Lucas GervaisAt first, Hoop for iOS or Android looks just like Tinder. You create an account with some photos and bio information, and start swiping through profiles. If you like someone, you tap a Snapchat button to request their Snap username so you can message them.But then Hoop reveals its savvy virality and monetization strategy. Rather than being able to endlessly ;swipe right; and approach people, Hoop limits your asks by making you spend its in-app ;diamonds; currency to reach out. After about 10 requests to chat, you;ll have to earn more diamonds. You do that by sharing and getting friends to open your invite link to the app, adding people on Snapchat that you meet on Hoop, logging in each day, taking a survey, watching a video ad and completing offers by signing up for streaming services or car insurance providers. It also trades diamonds for rating Hoop in the App Store, though that might run afoul of Apple;s rules.Those tactics helped Hoop climb as high as No. 2 on the overall iOS chart and No. #1 on the Social Apps chart on January 24th. It;s now at No. 83 overall and No. 7 in social, putting it above apps like Discord, LinkedIn, Skype and new Vine successor Byte. Hoop had more than 3 million installs as of a week ago.There are certainly some concerns, though. Gervais claims that ;We are not a meeting or dating app. We simply offer an easy way to make new Snap friends.; But because Tinder isn;t available for people under 18, they might be looking to Hoop instead. Thankfully, adults can;t see profiles of users under 18, and vice versa, and users only see potential matches in their age group. However, users can edit their age at any time.Snap Kit keeps startups leanTools like Amazon;s AWS have made building a startup with a lean team and little money increasingly easy. Snap Kit;s ability to let developers skip the account creation and management process is another step in that direction. But the power to imbue overnight virality is something even Facebook never accomplished, though it helped build empires for developers like Zynga.Another Snap Kit app called Yolo for receiving anonymous responses to questions shot up to No. 1 in May. Seven months later, it;s still at No. 51. That shows Snap Kit can offer longevity, not just flash-in-the-pan download spikes. Gervais calls the platform ;a very powerful tool for developers.;#1 app YOLO Q&#038;A is the Snapchat platform;s 1st hitThree years ago I wrote that Snapchat;s anti-developer attitude was a liability. It needed to become a platform with a cadre of allies that could strengthen its role as an identity platform for teens, and insulate it against copycats like Facebook. That;s exactly what it did. By letting other apps launch themselves using its accounts, Stories and Bitmoji, they wouldn;t need to copy its social graph, sharing format or avatars, and instead would drive attention to the originals.If Snap can keep building useful developer tools, perhaps by adding to its platform real-world object scanning, augmented reality filters and video calling, a Snapchat account could become a must-have for anyone who wants to use the next generation of apps. Then could come the crown jewel of a platform: discovery and virality. By building a section for promoting Snap Kit apps into Snapchat Discover, developers looking for shortcuts in both engineering and growth might join Evan Spiegel;s army.Snap;s anti-developer attitude is an augmented liability",https://tcrn.ch/2GWwkjd
1942331,2020-02-05T10:36:52,German drone delivery trial paves the way to replacing trucks for inter-office deliveries,"Drone startup Wingcopter,  working with partners Merck  and the Frankfurt University of Applied Science, has completed a first flight of a new drone delivery trial designed to show the benefits of using drones instead of trucks or other road-faring vehicles for moving small cargo between two physically separate office facilities. This first flight covered around 25 km (roughly 15.5 miles), taking a sample of pigments from one Merck lab in Gernsheim to its headquarters in Darmstadt in Germany.This trial is significant in more ways than one: The area it covered spanned a fairly dense metropolitan area, flying over power lines, trains, roadways and more. It also did all of this without continuous line-of-sight, something that;s been required of most drone delivery trials in a commercial setting to date. The partners involved are hoping this means it can stand as a blueprint to other similar pilot projects and trials being run all over the world.Next up, the project will continue to fly additional deliveries and then summarize their findings in a report to be delivered in March. Already, using drones instead of trucks seems to provide advantages in terms of time (saving between an hour and even a full day in some cases) and emissions, and it can cut down on the amount of empty return trips made by large, heavy gas-guzzling vehicles, as well.Wingcopter CEO Tom Plümmer points out in a press release detailing the news that his company has ;repeatedly demonstrated; the advantages of drone delivery across a number of use cases, including for use in getting life-saving medical supplies to remote areas. Trials in the U.S. include Alphabet;s Wing, which partnered with FedEx, and UPS, which is working with Matternet, but this commercial trial shows a potentially more fruitful avenue for deploying services in the near-term that don;t require buy-in from the average consumer.",https://tcrn.ch/2OwY6XE

1942149,2020-02-05T07:08:06,Aiven raises $40M to democratize access to open-source projects through managed cloud services,"The growing ubiquity of open-source software has been a big theme in the evolution of enterprise IT. But behind that facade of popularity lies another kind of truth: Companies may be interested in using more open-source technology, but because there is a learning curve with taking on an open-source project, not all of them have the time, money and expertise to adopt it. Today, a startup out of Finland that has built a platform specifically to target that group of users is announcing a big round of funding, underscoring not just demand for its products, but its growth to date.Aiven ; which provides managed, cloud-based services designed to make it easier for businesses to build services on top of open-source projects ; is today announcing that it has raised $40 million in funding, a Series B being led by IVP (itself a major player in enterprise software, backing an illustrious list that includes Slack, Dropbox, Datadog, GitHub and HashiCorp).Previous investors Earlybird VC, Lifeline Ventures and the family offices of Risto Siilasmaa (chairman of Nokia), and Olivier Pomel (founder of Datadog), also participated. The deal brings the total raised by Aiven  to $50 million.Oskari Saarenmaa, the CEO of Aiven who co-founded the company with Hannu Valtonen, Heikki Nousiainen and Mika Eloranta, said in an interview that the company is not disclosing its valuation at this time, but it comes in the wake of some big growth for the company.It now has 500 companies as customers, including Atlassian, Comcast, OVO Energy and Toyota, and over the previous two years it doubled headcount and tripled its revenues.;We are on track to do better than that this year,; Saarenmaa added.It;s a surprising customer list, given the size (and tech DNA) of some of those companies. Indeed, Saarenmaa even said that originally he and the co-founders ; who got the idea for the startup by first building such implementations for previous employers, which included Nokia and F-Secure ; envisioned much smaller, and less tech-centric organisations using Aiven.But in truth, the actual uptake speaks not just to that learning curve you get with open-source projects, but to the fact that even if you do have the talent to work with these, it makes more sense to apply that talent elsewhere and use implementations that have been tried and tested.The company today provides services on top of eight different open-source projects ; Apache Kafka, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, Redis, InfluxDB and Grafana ; which cover a variety of basic functions, from data streams to search and the handling of a variety of functions that involve ordering and managing vast quantities of data. It works across big public clouds, including Google, Azure, AWS, Digital Ocean and more.Aiven is running two other open-source technologies in beta ; M3 and Flink ; which will also soon be added on general release, and the plan will be to add a few more over time, but only a few.;We may want to have something to help with analytics and data visualisation,; Saarenmaa said, ;but we’re not looking to become a collection of different open-source databases. We want to provide the most interesting and best to our customers. The idea is that we are future-proofing. If there is an interesting technology that comes up and starts to be adopted, our users can trust it will be available on Aiven.;He says that today the company does not ; and has no plans to ; position itself as a system integrator or consultancy around open-source technologies. The work that it does do with customers, he said, is free and tends to be part of its pre- and after-sales care.One primary use of the funding will be to expand its on-the-ground offices in different geographies ; Aiven has offices in Helsinki, Berlin and Sydney today ; with a specific focus on the U.S., in order to be closer to customers to continue to do precisely that.But sometimes the mountain comes to Mohamed, so to speak. Saarenmaa said that he was first introduced to IVP at Slush, an annual tech conference in Helsinki held in November, and the deal came about quickly after that introduction.;The increasing adoption of open-source infrastructure software and public cloud usage are among the incredibly powerful trends in enterprise technology and Aiven is making it possible for customers of all sizes to benefit from the advantages of open source infrastructure,; Eric Liaw, a general partner at IVP, said in a statement.“In addition to their market potential and explosive yet capital-efficient growth, we were most impressed to hear from customer after customer that ‘Aiven just works.’ The overwhelmingly positive feedback from customers is a testament to their hiring practices and the strong engineering team they have built. We’re thrilled to partner with Aiven’s team and help them build their vision of a single open-source data cloud that serves the needs of customers of all sizes.”Liaw is joining the board with this round.",https://tcrn.ch/2SgPLsi
1942187,2020-02-05T07:05:27,Clear gets $13M Series A to build high-volume transaction system on the blockchain,"Clear is an early-stage startup with a big ambition. It wants to build a blockchain for high-volume transaction systems like payments between telcos. Today it announced a $13 million Series A investment.The round was led by Eight Roads with participation from Telefónica Innovation Ventures, Telekom Innovation Pool of Deutsche Telekom, HKT and Singtel Innov8.That the strategic investors were telcos is not a coincidence. The early use case for Clear;s blockchain transaction network involves moving payments between worldwide telcos, a system that today is highly manual and prone to errors.Clear co-founder Gal Hochberg says what his company does is to take commercial contracts and turn them into digital representations, often known in digital ledger terms as a smart contract.;What that lets us do is create a trusted view of the true status of the relationship within the company;s business partners because they;re now looking at the same pricing and usage. They can find any issues in real time, either in commercial information or in service delivery, and they can even actually resolve those inside our platform,; Hochberg explained.By putting these high-volume, cross-border transactions onto the blockchain with these smart contracts to act as automated enforcer of the terms, it means that instead of waiting until the end of the month to find errors and begin a resolution process, this can be done in real time, reducing time to payment and speeding up conflict resolution.;We use blockchain technology to create those interactions in ways that it is auditable, cryptographically secure and ensures that both sides are synced and seeing the same information,; Hochberg said.For starters, the company is working with worldwide telco companies because the number of transactions, and the way they cross borders make this a good test case, but Hochberg says this is only the starting point. They are not in full-blown production yet, but he says they have proven they can process hundreds of millions of billable events.The money should help the company get into full carrier-grade production some time in the first half of this year, and then begin to expand into other verticals beyond telcos with the help of today;s investment.Kadena fulfills hybrid blockchain vision with launch of public chain",https://tcrn.ch/2tv7Uu0

Until very recently.Foxtrot, founded in 2013, is looking to reimagine the corner convenience store, offering customers the option to buy in-store or order online for delivery.The company today announced the close of a $17 million growth round, co-led by Imaginary and Wittington Ventures,  with investment from previous backers Fifth Wall, Lerer Hippeau, Revolution’s Rise of the Rest Seed Fund, M3 Ventures, The University of Chicago, Collaborative VC and Wasson Enterprise, as well as new investors Bluestein Associates and Barshop Ventures.Foxtrot  offers a wide variety of products to customers, including craft beer and natural wines, familiar brands like Oreo and everyday goods like Bounty paper towels, as well as products under the Foxtrot label like sandwiches, prepped meals and coffee. It;s an impressive mix of local, emerging and heritage brands all under one roof. In total, Foxtrot works with more than 100 vendors to supply customers with upwards of 800 different products.Founder and CEO Mike LaVitola says that there is an even breakdown between Foxtrot;s own products (coffee, sandwiches, gummy candies), emerging brands (Hims, MatchaBar, etc.) and staple products and brands (Bud Light and Oreo).But the roof isn;t necessarily all that important. Foxtrot offers on-demand delivery of its full product suite via an app. And moreover, Foxtrot;s loyalty program offers free delivery for a month for folks who spent more than $100 (either in-store or online) last month at Foxtrot.[gallery ids=""1942166,1942160,1942165,1942164,1942163""]Foxtrot has stores in Dallas and Chicago, with plans to expand its footprint in those markets, as well as launch in D.C.The company says it;s experiencing 2x year-over-year revenue growth, with 150% YOY growth of its e-commerce customer base. Its revenue is split 50/50 between offline and online sales.In terms of employment, the workers inside the store who pick and pack and serve offline customers are W2 employees. Couriers are contractors but are employed directly by Foxtrot based on the company;s own best practices around on-demand delivery.LaVitola identifies maintaining a cohesive experience across retail and online as one of the greatest challenges.;They;re fundamentally different,; said LaVitola. ;The things that make one successful are very different from the things that make the other side successful. Going forward, to be as successful as we;ve been in these first markets, we need to make sure that the customer is coming to us online and in the store, and that they feel that they;re seeing the same brands and the same ecosystem.;",https://tcrn.ch/36Z9D8O
1942192,2020-02-05T06:58:42,Mobile banking alternative Bnext expands to Mexico,"Spanish startup Bnext is expanding beyond its home country. The company is currently rolling out its product in Mexico, and 170,000 people signed up to a waiting list. Bnext is going to invite those 170,000 potential users first before opening signups to everyone.Bnext  is building an alternative to traditional bank accounts. Customers can open a Bnext account in minutes using a mobile app. A few days later, users receive a payment card. You can then upload money to your Bnext account, and send and spend money all around the world.You can receive notifications for each transaction with your card, temporarily lock and unlock your card and more. In other words, Bnext does many of the things that you expect from a neobank.Unlike many traditional retail banks, Bnext plans to attract customers with cheaper international transactions. For instance, Spanish customers traveling abroad can withdraw money up to three times per month and spend as much as €2,000 per month without any foreign exchange fee. When you reach those limits, you pay 1.15% to 1.5% in foreign exchange fees. Mexican customers get two free withdrawals per month.The startup has put together a local team in order to expand to Mexico. There are currently 12 employees working for Bnext in Mexico City.But Bnext doesn’t want to stop at providing a current account with a card. In Spain, the company is building a financial hub to help you manage your money across multiple financial services. You can lend money to small and medium businesses and earn interest through October, you can save money using Raisin, you can get a loan, a mortgage, an insurance product, etc.Bnext expects to launch its marketplace in Mexico at some point during the second half of 2020. The company also expects to expand to other countries in Latin America in the future.When it comes to numbers, Bnext has attracted 300,000 active users in Spain. In the last 12 months, the startup has processed €430 million across 11.6 million transactions.",https://tcrn.ch/2OrytaD
1942131,2020-02-05T06:30:04,Deliverr lands $40M Series C to bring two-day shipping to any merchant,"Deliverr doesn;t own a warehouse or a delivery truck, but the startup is helping e-commerce companies not named Amazon achieve Amazon-like two-day shipping. The startup does it with intelligent algorithms, and today it announced a $40 million Series C investment.Activant Capital  led the round. Other investors in the company include 8VC, GLP and Flexport founder and CEO Ryan Peterson. The company reports it has raised a total of $70 million.;What we enable a merchant to do is offer free two-day delivery anywhere they sell, whether it;s Walmart, eBay, even Amazon, because we integrate into Prime or their own website,; Deliverr  CEO and co-founder Michael Krakaris told TechCrunch. They also added a recent program for merchants who want next-day delivery.The question is, how do they do this without owning a single warehouse or a single delivery truck? Krakaris says he cut his teeth at Twilio, a company that delivered message services without being a carrier. As he learned there, if you have good data and a good algorithm, you can build a business.They have also built relationships with a network of warehouses across the country, and as Krakaris pointed out, most warehouses have unused space. So based on their understanding of markets, they move goods to different parts of the country, store them in available warehouse space and use the warehouse;s own picking systems to grab the goods.The big thing is that they integrate into the warehouse;s Warehouse Management System software, so that orders coming through their system will integrate with the warehouse;s, get picked, processed and put on a truck. The system also helps find the fastest, cheapest way to deliver the goods on time.This involves two algorithms, an in-bound algorithm and an outbound one. ;Inbound is when a merchant is getting started sending inventory into the Deliverr network. And so we;re doing a few things. If it;s a repeat item, we already have a demand graph for that item so we;re just optimizing that existing demand,; he explained. He says there is some common sense in that you;ll see certain items tend to be consistent throughout the year, but you don;t want to put warm jackets in Florida and California.The other piece is outbound, figuring the fastest, cheapest way to deliver that item. They have relationships with a variety of national and regional carriers, and when an order comes in, they look at the inventory and location and figure out the optimal choice, based on price and ability to get there in the delivery window. Krakaris says they have a success rate of over 95%, which is near the top of the industry.The company launched in 2017. They are serving thousands of merchants using data with just 60 employees. That;s a testament to the power of data and good algorithms.Deliverr raises $7M to help e-commerce businesses compete with Amazon Prime",https://tcrn.ch/2tBIbjO
1942111,2020-02-05T05:43:35,The Zebra raises $38.5M as the insurance marketplace race heats up,"This morning The Zebra, an Austin-based insurance marketplace startup, announced it has closed a $38.5 million Series C. Accel led the funding event, which was participated in by prior investors Silverton Partners, Ballast Point Ventures, and the company;s CEO Keith Melnick. Floodgate and Weatherford Capital also invested in the round.According to Melnick, the company had targeted a final sum closer to $30 million, but interest in putting more capital into the business by the company;s extant investor set led to a larger Series C. The Zebra previously raised a number of Seed rounds, and a $17 million Series C led by Ballast and a $40 million Series B led by Accel.The Zebra joins competing startups, including Insurify ($23 million), Gabi ($27 million) and Policygenius ($100 million) in raising new capital this year. Why are venture capitalists putting so much money into the space? When we recently posed the question, we posited revenue growth among its constituent players and a total addressable market that was attractive as likely reasons why.Happily, The Zebra released some hard performance numbers in conjunction with its round, which not only show why the company was able to raise more capital but also why its space is hot.Why VCs are dumping money into insurance marketplacesPerformanceWhen most startups raise capital they are rarely share performance results and business metrics. This leads to press releases so insipid and anodyne that many rounds are covered by precisely zero members of the media.One way to avoid this bland fate is to share at least directional results. ARR growth, say, on a year-over-year basis. The next level of transparency ; and therefore flavor ; is providing real figures. Which is what The Zebra did as part of its Series C. Here they are:The Zebra currently sees ;1.3 million monthly website visitors.;The company;s revenue ;grew almost 200% year over year to nearly $37 million in 2019.;Its annual run rate (not annual recurring revenue, mind) is now over $60 million.The company expects to ;grow well over 100% in 2020.;It;s an impressive list of metrics. An interview with the company;s CEO helped fill in a few more details.According to Melnick, The Zebra is improving customer acquisition costs over time, as it is also improving its revenue generation (both categories on a unit basis), implying that the company isn;t spending its capital on driving artificial growth.Given the company;s expected growth when is the IPO? Melnick cited his time at Kayak (which went public), listening to investor Mike Moritz who was skeptical at times of going public. Melnick joked that, ;Like [with] most things, Mike was right.; The Zebra isn;t focused on any particular exit, he said. Instead, it wants to execute well, which will provide the company with a number of options when the time is right.In summation: the Zebra;s $38.5 million brings us to $185.5 million raised by four insurance marketplaces so far in 2020. It;s going to be fascinating to see where all the startups are at the end fo 2020 and if any have linked up by then.",https://tcrn.ch/31uo0AU

The firm makes just a handful of investments per year, mostly at the Series A stage, working very closely with founders in its portfolio, a strategy it refers to as “high conviction” investing.One of its chosen few is Inne, a Berlin-based femtech startup that’s building a novel, hormone-tracking subscription product for fertility-tracking and ;natural; contraception. The aim is to offer a high-tech alternative to taking hormones to prevent pregnancy or using an established barrier method (such as a condom).Inne came out of stealth last fall to announce $8.8M in funding, giving us the first glimpse of the medical device it’s been working on since 2017. This test-at-home hormone tracker is slated to launch in select markets in Scandinavia this year, but at a scale akin to a limited beta. The startup said it would be iterating the product based on feedback from the first usersWe chatted with Blossom Capital  partner Louise Samet, who led the fund’s investment in Inne, to get the inside track on that deal and further understand how the fund thinks about femtech and the key challenges and opportunities she sees for founders building products targeted to women.This interview has been edited for length and clarity. TechCrunch: How does the fund approach femtech?Samet: The way we define femtech is products that are built for women. But I think the definition of the term is not necessarily important.

But most small businesses, especially neighborhood stores and merchants, remain offline.A wave of startups in the country today are trying to make it easier for these merchants and businesses to come online. GetMeAShop is one such startup. It runs a platform that allows businesses to set up their website, build an online store, and make it easier for merchants or individuals to engage with ; and sell to ; their customers through social apps such as WhatsApp and Facebook.For Instamojo, this acquisition is not surprising. The seven-year-old startup began its journey as a payments provider for small businesses. Over the years, it has launched an online store, and a lending service to serve more needs of a business.Two years ago, the startup added logistics service to the platform through partnership with a handful of firms in the nation, allowing its merchants to have their packages picked up from their doorstep.;This acquisition will allow us to become a full-fledged operating system for businesses,; said Swain.Instamojo has amassed 1.2 million merchants on its platform. ;It took us seven years to get a million merchants on the platform. Now we are adding more than 2,000 a day. We are on track to hit 2 million merchants by the end of this year,; he said.The startup also operates an app store that allows developers to use Instamojo;s system to build their own apps and make money. Instamojo currently does not charge any commission to its developers, but in the future it plans to explores monetization opportunities.Pushkal Srivastava, founder and chief executive of GetMeAShop, said the acquisition will give the startup access to ;distribution specific to the target segment we;ve been going after for all these years.; He added, ;with our full-stack SaaS offering for MSMEs with web and commerce builder [and] CRM and analytics built-in, we augment the existing offerings of Instamojo perfectly.”",https://tcrn.ch/2SwAsfp
1941956,2020-02-04T15:24:57,"Layoffs hit Flexport, another SoftBank-backed startup worth $3.2B","Fearing weak fundraising options in the wake of the WeWork implosion, late-stage startups are tightening their belts. The latest is another Softbank-funded company, joining Zume Pizza (80 percent of staff laid off), Wag (80 percent),  Fair (40%), Getaround (25 percent), Rappi (6 percent), and Oyo (5 percent) that have all cut staff to slow their burn rate and reduce their funding needs. Now freight forwarding startup Flexport is laying off 3 percent of its global staff.;We;re restructuring some parts of our organization to move faster and with greater clarity and purpose. With that came the difficult decision to part ways with around 50 employees; a Flexport  spokesperson tells TechCrunch after we asked today if it had seen layoffs like its peers.Flexport CEO Ryan PetersenFlexport had raised a $1 billion Series D led by SoftBank  at a $3.2 billion valuation a year ago, bringing it to $1.3 billion in funding. The company helps move shipping containers full of goods between manufacturers and retailers using digital tools unlike its old-school competitors.;We underinvested in areas that help us serve clients efficiently, and we over-invested in scaling our existing process when we actually needed to be agile and adaptable to best serve our clients, especially in a year of unprecedented volatility in global trade,; the spokesperson explained.Flexport still had a record year, working with 10,000 clients to finance and transport goods. The shipping industry is so huge that it;s still only the seventh largest freight forwarder on its top Trans-Pacific Eastbound leg. The massive headroom for growth plus its use of software to coordinate supply chains and optimize routing is what attracted SoftBank.The Flexboard Platform dashboard offers maps, notifications, task lists, and chat for Flexport clients and their factory suppliers.But many late-stage startups are worried about where they;ll get their next round after taking huge sums of cash from SoftBank at tall valuations. As of November, SoftBank had only managed to raise about $2 billion for its Vision Fund 2 despite plans for a total of $108 billion, Bloomberg reported. LPs were partially spooked by SoftBank;s reckless investment in WeWork. Further layoffs at its portfolio companies could further stoke concerns about entrusting it with more cash.Unless growth-stage startups can cobble together enough institutional investors to build big rounds, or other huge capital sources like sovereign wealth funds materialize for them, these startups might not be able to raise enough to keep rapidly burning. Those that can;t reach profitability or find an exit may face down-rounds that can come with onerous terms, trigger talent exodus death spirals, or just not provide enough money.Logistics startup Flexport just raised a SoftBank-led round at a whopping $3.2 billion valuationFlexport has managed to escape with just 3 percent layoffs for now. Being proactive about cuts to reach sustainability may be smarter than gambling that one;s business or the funding climate with suddenly improve. But while other SoftBank startups had to spend tons to edge out direct competitors or make up for weak on-demand service margins, Flexport at least has a tried and true business where incumbents have been asleep at the wheel.",https://tcrn.ch/2tvvC9F

Amazon has a host of data concerning its merchant-partners and Goldman has a pile of money; by combining their powers, they can probably make some money loaning out capital.The Goldman news is merely an amuse-bouche, however.

It now plans to explore opening up in three new markets and will begin a Vegas launch in March with a fresh infusion of $23 million in Series B equity financing.While most real estate outfits now cater to customers online, Homie  takes a different approach, employing real estate agents who will help them through the process but who don;t take a commission. Instead, sellers get a $1,500 flat fee and buyers and sellers are guaranteed built-in attorney assistance for the negotiation process.The 6% traditional commission associated with the home-buying process has been around for decades. However, it has also come under fire from the Department of Justice, which recently disagreed with a motion from the National Association of Realtors to dismiss several civil lawsuits lobbied against the organization. The move hints that the U.S. government may see these fees as archaic and unjustified, as well.How do traditional agents feel about a proposed loss of commission? Those outside of Homie TechCrunch spoke to on anonymity have said it often takes more work with less pay to close a deal this way. However, that structure seems to resonate with Homie users. Through Homie, the company claims to have saved over $55 million in commissions, with a revenue growth of 150% over the past year. This bodes well for the company, if true.The ability to expand is also a possibly good marker for the health of the company. Homie co-founder Johnny Hanna told TechCrunch previously he;d looked at the Vegas area, as well as Dallas for expansion.A few other places we could see Homie pop up in the next year include Boise, Seattle, Colorado Springs and Nashville.The other new news out of Homie this year is the addition of real estate adjacent services like Homie Loans™, Homie Title™ and Homie Insurance™, all of which serve to streamline the process for customers.;Buying or selling a home is expensive and time-consuming because of all the different companies you have to work with,” Hanna said in a statement. ;Communication becomes a game of telephone because of all the parties involved. We are disrupting the traditional model and saving customers thousands of dollars by combining technology, a team of experts, and a one-stop-shop for real estate.

Once the service is generally available later this summer, users will be able to spin it up on AWS and Microsoft Azure, with support for Google Cloud coming a bit later this year. This, the company claims, makes it the first ;SQL-on-NoSQL DBaaS that supports multiple cloud providers.;What;s probably more important for its customers, though, is that Couchbase  Cloud will allow them to retain full control of their data inside their own Virtual Private Cloud. Couchbase promises that deploying the service only takes a few clicks and, as you would expect from a fully managed service, the company will handle managing and upgrading the database service.The underlying infrastructure stack uses open-source technologies like Kubernetes, Prometheus  and Grafana, but as a fully managed service, that;s not something the users will actually have to worry about all that much. Indeed, Couchbase stresses how its service decouples the underlying infrastructure from its database solution. That includes pricing. Couchbase doesn;t charge its users for the infrastructure they consume. Instead, they;ll continue to pay their cloud provider as usual, which also means they can take advantage of cost savings from reserved instances and other discounts that the various cloud providers make available to their customers.

For sellers who aren;t integrated with Shopify, they can have their data processed by Retina to get that predicted customer value. The company guarantees brands a 20% to 30% lower cost per acquisition of online customers or their money back.Retina bases its analysis on recency, frequency and churn rates to map out customer acquisition, according to the company;s spokesperson. The software collects that data by analyzing the log of previous transactions in a customer data or payment platform, according to a statement.“Not all customers are created equal and, in fact, a majority of them are poison for the business,” said Michael Greenberg, Retina co-founder and chief executive, in a statement. “Retina determines which customers will spend more as soon as they make their first purchase, not six months from now. Our customers are saving millions of dollars in online advertising, while also increasing sales. This funding allows us to expand our services and bring our insights to even more brands in 2020.”Customers already using the product include online retailers like Madison Reed and the subscription grooming company, Dollar Shave Club.",https://tcrn.ch/2RZmraR

The company launched onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt five years ago.The premise was simple. A young startup wanted to build a bank that didn;t suck. Given the company’s impressive growth rate and its 4.8-star rating in the App Store, it’s clear that N26 is on the right path. Some people finally found a bank that they like interacting with.I interviewed N26’s  Chief Product Officer Georgina Smallwood about how she leads product at one of Europe;s  biggest consumer startups. In this wide-ranging discussion, we talk about her role in the organization, how the product and design team communicates and how she finds inspiration for game-changing ideas. The interview was slightly edited for clarity and brevity.TechCrunch: How did you end up working for N26 and in that position in particular?Georgina Smallwood: I’ve been in tech for almost 15 years now, mostly on the marketplace side of things. I’ve been really focused on the advertising marketplaces, properties, classifieds, things like that. My product career took me from Australia to Hong Kong, where I set up a business there under another company. I did lots of different things and ended up in Germany working on the IPO for a company called Scout24, which is a property classifieds business. That was about four years ago. After I left, I went back to Australia. But I think that because I;ve worked in Germany before, we had a couple of connections in common.",https://tcrn.ch/397MPoy
1941512,2020-02-04T07:01:11,Lemonade is getting into pet insurance,"Lemonade, the homeowners and renters insurance provider that;s raised $480 million, has announced its plans to expand into pet insurance. This marks the startup;s foray into a new insurance vertical.To be clear, Lemonade  is simply announcing its plans. Right now, the company is going through the regulatory process, which will make its intentions a matter of public record. The actual pet insurance product won;t be available until the regulatory process is completed, which could take ;months,; according to founder and CEO Daniel Schreiber.All that said, we don;t know too many details about the product, like price or the type of coverage that will be offered. We do know, however, that the coverage will be exclusively for dogs and cats.A very small fraction of pet owners in the U.S. actually have pet insurance, with numbers ranging between 1 and 2%. Meanwhile, 70% of Lemonade customers who have purchased a homeowners or renters policy are also pet owners, according to Schreiber.Schreiber explained that dog ownership is one of many signals used by Lemonade to determine homeowner and renter insurance quotes, as dogs can sometimes play a factor in the risk-assessment of a home, such as deterring burglary. Around 90% of Lemonade customers are purchasing an insurance policy for the first time.Considering those numbers, it makes sense for Lemonade to target that massive segment of its audience with a new product. And it doesn;t hurt that, in general, Americans are spending more and more on their pets, with the country spending an estimated $75 billion in 2019 alone.;Health insurance for pets dates back to over 100 years ago,; said Schreiber. ;It started with horses in the Netherlands, and the heir to that pet insurance is actually car insurance. Horses were a mode of transportation, and the insurance was meant to protect you if something happened to that mode of transportation. But pets are now members of the family.;Lemonade writes the stack for both its technology and its insurance, acting as a carrier rather than a broker. This gives it some flexibility around the way its policy is actually written. The company has been trying to get regulators on board with an updated, simplified renters insurance policy that gives folks clear insight into what exactly they;re paying for.Schreiber says that the pet insurance policy follows on that path, calling it a ;very simple policy; that is ;written in readable language.;Lemonade came on the scene in 2015 with a plan to change the way we approach insurance. The company offered a chatbot to take users through the on-boarding process, asking a series of questions and retrieving a quote in about a minute. The company also re-engineered the business model of insurance, wherein Lemonade would take its revenue cut each month and the rest of the unclaimed value would be given to the user;s preferred charity at the end of the year.Schreiber confirmed that the same chatbot flow and charitable contribution features would be included in the pet insurance product.Folks can sign up for early access to Lemonade;s pet insurance here.",https://tcrn.ch/2v7RN5Z

There is not a wealth of training options for gamers. If you can;t get better within the environment of the game itself, then you;ve peaked. Practice makes perfect, but what if there;s no such thing as practice?The Meta is looking to change that with the launch of a new training platform that builds off the success of Kovaak;s FPS Aim Trainer. Kovaak is a former Quake pro, known for his hyper-accurate aim, who built Kovaak;s FPS Aim Trainer out of personal need. He wanted a way to grind out his mechanical aiming skills, and built out various scenarios across 10+ major titles to practice.The Meta co-founders Duncan Haberly, Jay Brown, and Chris Olson had been working on their own training platform that focuses on guided trainings around specific skills, with physics and gun mechanics identical to popular titles, to let gamers learn from their mistakes and train better habits.After the two esports entrepreneurial teams met, they decided to join forces and offer what they believe to be the ultimate training tool.It;s comprised of two parts. The first is The Meta;s self-guided training platform, with various branches that focus on a different skill set in FPS gaming. The second is Kovaak;s Sandbox, the aim trainer that lets users test the skills they;ve learned by playing through more than 2,600 user-generated scenarios.For now, The Meta-guided training focuses on flicking (otherwise known as click timing), with plans to introduce tracking and scoping skill branches soon. The self-guided training side of the platform feeds users insights about their deficiencies — maybe they tend to miss their shots when enemies are in the upper-left quadrant of the screen — so they can dedicate time and energy to improving that part of their game in the aim trainer.[gallery ids=""1941505,1941506,1941507,1941508""]The Meta is available on Steam for PC players, with plans to launch for consoles in the future.The flicking trainer has more than 40 sub-levels, with support for Overwatch  and Fortnite. Kovaak;s Sandbox, as the FPS Aim Trainer is now known, has more than 2,600 user-created scenarios, and supports titles like Overwatch, Fortnite, Quake, Call of Duty, Apex Legends, Paladins, CS:GO, Battlefield and Rainbow 6.The Meta is $9.99 as a single-time payment, and the company says it;s currently averaging 20,000 units sold per month. The gaming startup has raised $2.5 million in funding from investors like Village Global, Canaan Beta Fund, Courtside VC, AET Fund (Akatsuki Entertainment Technology), betaworks and GFR Fund (GREE).There is movement in the esports space around training and improvement. In 2018, Epic Games introduced Playground Mode to allow players a chance to experience the Fortnite environment without dropping in alongside 99 other gamers. PlayVS, the startup looking to take the esports infrastructure to the high school and college level, is investing heavily in data, reporting stats and analysis to players, coaches, fans and recruiters. StateSpace, a direct competitor to The Meta with $4 million in funding, uses neuroscience to help gamers train, hoping to create a standardized metric by which gamers; skills can be measured.Esports is growing across almost every metric, from viewership to awareness to revenue, and with that, we can only expect to see more startups dive into the space and stake their claim.",https://tcrn.ch/31vyH63

Firefly will launch a constellation of small satellites on behalf of Satlantis that will provide high-res, multispectral imaging of Earth from low Earth orbit.Firefly is still in the development and testing phase of their first launch vehicle, the Alpha rocket and spacecraft. The company intends to fly Alpha for the first time sometime this year, and the agreement signed today with Satlantis specifies a 2022 time frame for the mission.Alpha is a two-stage rocket that uses a carbon composite material for its primary construction. It;s around 95 feet tall, and can carry approximately 2,200 lbs to low Earth orbit. Like Rocket Lab,  Firefly;s goal is to provide an affordable option for small satellite customers to have dedicated launches, rather than relying on having to book rideshare missions, but it offers considerably more payload capacity.Firefly has just begun running its ;hot; fire tests of its engine with the vehicle vertical early in 2020, but it did encounter a setback at the end of January with a fire on the launch platform following the first of these tests. Firefly said the fire was due to a fuel leak, but continues work on Alpha and Firefly. CEO Tom Markusic told KVUE that it shouldn;t affect their goal of having a first flight for the rocket by mid-year.",https://tcrn.ch/36VVcSR
1941405,2020-02-04T06:30:58,Emerge raises $20M to take its digital freight marketplace for truckers up a gear,"Trucking is currently the most popular mode of transporting freight in the U.S., accounting for around $12.5 billion of the $17 billion freight market, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. But with thousands of small and single-vehicle operators and legacy (often paper-based) systems underpinning communications, it;s also one of the most inefficient.Now there are signs that this is changing. A startup out of Phoenix, Ariz. called Emerge, which has built a platform for shippers and brokers to find and allocate truck freight more effectively across the long tail of available truck-based carriers (a little like a Flexport but for trucks), is announcing a round of $20 million, funding it will use to continue building out its technology, as well as to keep expanding business.The Series A ; led by NewRoad Capital Partners,  with previous investors Greycroft and 9Yards Capital also participating ; comes on the heels of some already strong traction for Emerge. Since being founded in 2018 by brothers Andrew and Michael Leto, the company has processed more than $1 billion in freight with 1,500% year-over-year growth between 2018 and 2019. Emerge has now raised just over $40 million and we understand that its valuation is currently at more than $100 million. Some of its traction so far is down to the founders. Both are vets of the trucking industry whose previous company, a multimodal shipment visibility/supply chain solutions platform called 10-4, sold to Trimble in a $400 million deal. And some of that is down to the gap in the market that Emerge is filling.;Gap; is actually the operative word here. How shipments are booked on trucks today is quite inefficient, with orders often leaving empty spaces on truck beds that could be filled with goods going in the same direction; and in about 20% of all journeys carrying no load at all.Part of the reason for this is the antiquated way that shippers book space on trucks, and part of the reason is because there is just simply too much fragmentation in the system, with 80% of all shipments today contract-based and the remaining 20% operating as a ;spot market; and booked on the fly, and neither of them particularly efficient when it comes to truck occupancy. (Most of the latter spot market is booked through spreadsheets and email, Michael Leto, the CEO, said in an interview.)Emerge;s  solution is something of a stick-and-carrot approach that reminds me a little also of how advertising exchanges work.A shipper that wants to use the Emerge platform essentially activates/lists its entire inventory of truck providers on the platform to get started. That list and inventory, in turn, become part of a bigger database of other providers: and again, this is a long-tail approach, with typically the trucking companies on the platform having no more than 200 trucks (and often fewer) in their fleets.Then, when a shipper goes to Emerge to book a shipment, options are provided that might include previous truckers, but might also include others. The idea is that this provides a more efficient picture, and that in turn gets passed on as cost savings to the customers, who can typically reduce shipping costs by as much as 20% using the platform.If the cost savings and expanded choice are the carrots, the stick comes in the form of the requirement to upload truck data and share it with other shippers: you can;t use the system without doing it.;But it’s a network effect,; Leto explained when I asked if Emerge ever saw resistance to the model. ;We allow these companies to share capacity to drive efficiencies, and to drive and lower costs with less deadhead miles. There are a lot of benefits to capacity sharing.; It doesn;t seem to have deterred too many in any case. There are currently some 30,000 carrier profiles on the platform, and 12,000 transportation entities — including carriers, brokers or other shippers — transacted in Q4 alone, speaking to activity on the platform being strong. Emerge is not the only company that has identified the opportunity in providing a better and more updated platform to communicate and book space in the fragmented truck market. Sennder out of Berlin ; which last year raised a sizeable round of funding ; has also built a platform to centralise communications around booking shipments. It, however, seems to have less of an emphasis on encouraging shippers to take the lead in expanding that network effect that Leto describes.Others that are tackling the wider shipping and logistics market and trying to improve how it runs include Sendy out of Kenya, which recently also announced a $20 million raise; Flexport, which now has a $3.2 billion valuation; Zencargo, which has also raised $20 million; and FreightHub ($30 million), Bringg ($25 million) and NEXT ($97 million).But within that, Emerge;s performance so far, coupled with the Leto brothers; history as founders, is giving the startup some extra mileage as we enter the next phase of what trucking might hold, which could include a critical mass of autonomous and electric vehicles on pre-defined routes.“Uniquely, Emerge combines an exciting new technology designed to serve existing, unmet market need with experienced industry operators and entrepreneurs,; said Tracy Black of NewRoad in a statement. ;Andrew and Michael are building the most innovative marketplace we’ve seen in the freight and digital marketplace industry ; bringing contracts and carriers together to create new capacity. We are excited to be leading their Series A and I am thrilled to join the board to support their growth.;",https://tcrn.ch/2GV6o7G
1941134,2020-02-04T05:00:56,Online-to-offline platform Sendoso raises $40M after growing 330% in 2019,"Email is garbage and we;re all buried in the stuff. Actually getting someone;s attention given the constraints that digital missives present is difficult. How do you snag someone;s eye when the Internet Age;s key communication channel is a mess?One option is to skip the inbox altogether and send something physical instead. That;s where a startup called Sendoso comes in. The company, flush today with $40 million in new capital from a Series B led by Oak HC/FT Partners (the HC/FT bit stands for healthcare and fintech), is accelerating its build-out of what it calls a ;sending platform; to help people get noticed by others when they deem it necessary.TechCrunch covered the company;s Series A in early 2019, when it raised $10.7 million. Sendoso has now raised north of $54 million during its life as a private company.In an interview with TechCrunch, Sendoso  CEO Kris Rudeegraap said that his company raised $40 million in a single round after having raised less than $15 million previously because it “nailed product-market fit.” Because of this, the Series B was “a very competitive round,” according to Rudeegraap, who added that the funding event was ;oversubscribed in terms of interest.”The startup also said it grew total revenue by 330 percent in 2019, compared to its 2018 result.All that growth is impressive, but what does Sendoso do, exactly? It’s a technology company with a large real-world footprint, which is why it’s a bit hard to describe. In practical terms, the company’s software helps customers “incorporate digital and physical sending strategies” to better attract attention, according to Rudeegraap.As TechCrunch detailed during the company;s Series A, the CEO previously worked in sales, where he began to branch out his communications strategy into sending corporate swag, handwritten notes and the like to prospective clients. The effort proved successful, he told TechCrunch, but was time-consuming.Sendoso is the productized version of Rudeegraap;s former sales methods. It calls its service a “sending platform,” noting on its website that it can send pretty much anything through its systems, including perishables. The company framed its market proposition in a release this morning as a way to “incorporate digital and physical sending strategies into their go-to-market programs.”The company builds software connecting customers to its own services, its services to customer CRM tooling and both to its warehouses to assist with the mailing of personalized items to teams and prospective clients.It;s not hard to wonder if the company might branch out a bit in time ; after all, it is building relationships with companies of all sorts and it has shipping experience and a growing warehouse footprint. What else might it send in time?Today, however, Sendoso appears focused on companies sending other companies gifts and items, often personalized. Sales is a big world. Powering sales is a big market. Let;s see if Sendoso can put up three-figure revenue growth again in 2020.",https://tcrn.ch/2UqJI71
1940981,2020-02-04T05:00:31,"Hinge Health, the digital solution for chronic back and joint pain, closes $90M Series C","Hinge Health, the San Francisco-based startup that offers a digital solution to treat chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions — such as back and joint pain — has closed a $90 million Series C.The round is led by Bessemer Venture Partners,  with participation from Lead Edge Capital. All of Hinge;s existing institutional investors followed on: Insight Partners (which led the Series B), Atomico (which led the Series A), 11.2 Capital, Quadrille Capital and Heuristic Capital.Founded in 2015 (and originally based in London), Hinge Health  primarily sells into U.S. employers and health plans, billing itself as a digital healthcare solution for chronic MSK conditions. The platform combines wearable sensors, an app and health coaching to remotely deliver physical therapy and behavioral health.The basic premise is that there is plenty of existing research to show how best to treat chronic MSK disorders, but existing healthcare systems aren;t up to the task due to funding pressures and for other systematic reasons. The result is an over tendency to use opioid-based painkillers or surgery, with poor results and often at even greater cost. Hinge wants to reverse this through the use of technology and better data, with a focus on improving treatment adherence.In a call and in subsequent message exchanges, Hinge CEO and co-founder Daniel Perez tells me the company is already helping two out of three elected surgeries be avoided, ;delivering a 3-4x ROI across our book of business.; More broadly, Hinge is helping four in five participants achieve ;a meaningful pain reduction,; with the average person on its program reducing their pain by 69%, claims Perez.;One thing we’re particularly happy about is that we’re cutting anxiety and depression rates by more than half,; he adds. ;This is really important, because a lot of people don’t appreciate how much mental health comorbidities, like depression or anxiety, can impact chronic pain.;Following Hinge;s Series B, Perez says he spent the first half of 2019 building out his team, with a particular emphasis on ;executive management, R&amp;D, clinical, and commercial footprint.; The company;s headcount sits at around 225 today, with plans to increase that to more than 400 in the next 12-18 months.Currently headquartered at Spotify’s former San Francisco offices, where around half of the staff is based, Hinge is planning to move to larger premises in the next three months.;We have a clinical team 10x larger than any of our competitors,; he says. Many of these are health coaches spread throughout the U.S., who are tasked with supporting patients proactively based on the data Hinge has access to.;Most companies are really good at enterprise or D2C; but in healthcare, while the purchasing decision is often made by an enterprise (employer, health plan, hospital etc.), the end-user is a patient who makes their own decision whether to engage. Early on we realised we needed to be maniacally focused on customer service, from both the enterprise and end-user perspective. That really paid off, because not only did our enterprise book triple in six months, but we’ve maintained 100% customer retention.;To that end, Perez claims that four in five employers with a digital MSK solution have bought Hinge Health. This has seen the company;s enterprise customer base triple in the last six months, resulting in 200 enterprise implementations.Meanwhile, Perez wouldn;t be drawn on Hinge;s Series C valuation, although one source tells me it was around $420 million. What he did confirm, however, is that he and co-founder Gabriel Mecklenburg still control half of the board;s voting rights. He also says the round was oversubscribed and Hinge could have raised $125 million plus, but ;chose to pull back.;Adds Bessemer Venture Partners Partner Steve Kraus, who led on behalf of the San Francisco-headquartered venture capital firm: ;U.S. employers and health plans are looking not just for outcomes, but also meaningful engagement and ; critically ; enterprise experience and maturity. That’s why we’ve invested in Hinge Health.;Rarely have I seen customers more enthusiastic about a product. In all of my customer reference calls (and there were many), the praise for Hinge Health’s product and especially their ease of implementation was universal.;",https://tcrn.ch/389pUck
1941396,2020-02-04T04:15:56,"Nomagic, a startup out of Poland, picks up $8.6M for its pick-and-place warehouse robots","Factories and warehouses have been two of the biggest markets for robots in the last several years, with machines taking on mundane, if limited, processes to speed up work and free up humans to do other, more complex tasks. Now, a startup out of Poland that is widening the scope of what those robots can do is announcing funding, a sign not just of how robotic technology has been evolving, but of the growing demand for more automation, specifically in the world of logistics and fulfilment.Nomagic, which has developed way for a robotic arm to identify an item from an unordered selection, pick it up and then pack it into a box, is today announcing that it has raised $8.6 million in funding, one of the largest-ever seed rounds for a Polish startup. Co-led by Khosla Ventures and Hoxton Ventures, the round also included participation from DN Capital, Capnamic Ventures and Manta Ray, all previous backers of Nomagic.There are a number of robotic arms on the market today that can be programmed to pick up and deposit items from Point A to Point B. But we are only starting to see a new wave of companies focus on bringing these to fulfilment environments because of the limitations of those arms: they can only work when the items are already ;ordered; in a predictable way, such as on an assembly line, which has mean that fulfilment of, for example, online orders is usually carried out by humans.Nomagic has incorporated a new degree of computer vision, machine learning and other AI-based technologies to  elevate the capabilities of those robotic arm. Robots powered by its tech can successfully select items from an ;unstructured; group of objects ; that is, not an assembly line, but potentially another box ; before picking it up and placing it elsewhere.Kacper Nowicki, the ex-Googler CEO of Nomagic who co-founded the company with Marek Cygan (an academic) and Tristan d;Orgeval (formerly of Climate Corporation), noted that while there has been some work on the problem of unstructured objects and industrial robots ; in the US, there are some live implementations taking shape, with one, Covariant, recently exiting stealth mode ; it has been mostly a ;missing piece; in terms of the innovation that has been done to make logistics and fulfilment more efficient.That is to say, there has been little in the way of bigger commercial roll outs of the technology, creating an opportunity in what is a huge market: fulfilment services are projected to be a $56 billion market by 2021 (currently the US is the biggest single region, estimated at between $13.5 billion and $15.5 billion).;If every product were a tablet or phone, you could automate a regular robotic arm to pick and pack,; Nowicki said. ;But if you have something else, say something in plastic, or a really huge diversity of products, then that is where the problems come in.;Nowicki was a longtime Googler who moved from Silicon Valley back to Poland to build the company;s first engineering team in the country. In his years at Google, Nowicki worked in areas including Google Cloud and search, but also saw the AI developments underway at Google;s DeepMind subsidiary, and decided he wanted to tackle a new problem for his next challenge.His interest underscores what has been something of a fork in artificial intelligence in recent years. While some of the earliest implementations of the principles of AI were indeed on robots, these days a lot of robotic hardware seems clunky and even outmoded, while much more of the focus of AI has shifted to software and ;non-physical; systems aimed at replicating and improving upon human thought. Even the word ;robot; is now just as likely to be seen in the phrase ;robotic process automation;, which in fact has nothing to do with physical robots, but software.;A lot of AI applications are not that appealing,; Nowicki simply noted (indeed, while Nowicki didn;t spell it out, DeepMind in particular has faced a lot of controversy over its own work in areas like healthcare). ;But improvements in existing robotics systems by applying machine learning and computer vision so that they can operate in unstructured environments caught my attention. There has been so little automation actually in physical systems, and I believe it;s a place where we still will see a lot of change.;Interestingly, while the company is focusing on hardware, it;s not actually building hardware per se, but is working on software that can run on the most popular robotic arms in the market today to make them ;smarter;.;We believe that most of the intellectual property in in AI is in the software stack, not the hardware,; said Orgeval. ;We look at it as a mechatronics problem, but even there, we believe that this is mainly a software problem.;Having Khosla as a backer is notable given that a very large part of the VC;s prolific investing has been in North America up to now. Nowicki said he had a connection to the firm by way of his time in the Bay Area, where before Google, Vinod Khosla backed a startup of his (which went bust in one of the dot-com downturns).While there is an opportunity for Nomagic to take its idea global, for now Khosla;s interested because of the a closer opportunity at home, where Nomagic is already working with third-party logistics and fulfilment providers, as well as retailers like Cdiscount, a French Amazon-style, soup-to-nuts online marketplace.“The Nomagic team has made significant strides since its founding in 2017,” says Sven Strohband, Managing Director of Khosla Ventures, in a statement. “There’s a massive opportunity within the European market for warehouse robotics and automation, and NoMagic is well-positioned to capture some of that market share.”",https://tcrn.ch/3946qGj
1941094,2020-02-04T04:00:47,Payments infra startup Finix closes $35M Series B led by Sequoia,"This morning Finix, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) startup selling payments tech to other businesses, announced that it has raised a $35 million Series B. Sequoia led the round, which also saw participation from new investors Activant Capital and Inspired Capital.Finix  did not disclose a new valuation as part of its round, and declined to share any growth metrics regarding its business. Instead, it offered a TAM figure and noted the number of countries in which it currently operates.The company;s latest round is a doubling of its Series A, a $17.5 million round from July of 2019 led by Bain Capital Ventures; Insight Venture Partners, Aspect Ventures and Visa also took part in that round. Adding to the list, Homebrew invested in the company during its infancy. (Update: Acrew Capital as well.)Finix has now raised more than $55 million to date, according to the company, inclusive of an October, 2017-era seed investment.The roundIn an interview, Finix;s Richie Serna told TechCrunch that his company put together its latest round ;to scale up the organization,; boosting its product and engineering muscles while also pursuing further international payment support. According to Serna, Finix;s larger clients have asked the company to expand international support, as having ;international reach is a really key component for any business.;Internationalization in the payments space requires many hands, a need that Finix intends to meet by doubling its staff by the end of the year. The company had around 60 staff at year;s end, Serna previously told TechCrunch.Notably Finix, despite being a player in the payments space, doesn;t think of itself as a payments company. Instead, according to its CEO, Finix self-describes ;as a payment infrastructure company.;That difference is reflected in how the company charges for its service. Instead of charging similarly to, say, Stripe, which takes 2.9% and $0.30 ;per successful card charge,; Finix charges its customers a regular software fee, along with a sliding fee depending on the number of payments they process.Not taking a percentage cut of transactions opens up interesting revenue opportunities for Finix customers. Serna detailed how bringing payment tech via Finix can help some companies grow top line, something that;s quite interesting for other SaaS players:Historically the distribution of payments has been fairly fragmented and almost bolted on. So there;s a number of software companies like MindBody and Toast, who, historically would just have sort of a revenue share with one of their payment processors. So if you signed up for someone like a MindBody as a yoga studio, you would then go and set up a partnership with FirstData or WorldPay to start accepting payments on that platform. In that model, someone like a MindBody would make a few basis points on every single transaction. By bringing their payments back in-house, and offering a more comprehensive, all in one solution, they can actually take more revenue.Startups can expand revenue by owning their own payments tech ; sometimes substantially. Serna told TechCrunch that Lightspeed said during their IPO process that ;they were actually doubling their overall take rate by becoming a payment company.;How does that work?The yoga example that Serna mentioned is easy to unpack by way of analogy. Doing so will help us better understand why Finix expects SaaS companies, to pick an example, to bring payment tech ;in-house.;Imagine you own a company called, say WeaveBasket, and that it sells SaaS software to underwater basket weaving instructional studios, helping them manage client booking and the like. You can charge only so much for company;s your software, presenting you with a revenue ceiling; after all, the average underwater basket weaving studio can only generate so much margin with which to pay costs. But if you set up WeaveBasket to help underwater basket weaving studios to also accept payments for classes through your software, you can generate lots more revenue for your SaaS company ; WeaveBasket generates revenue from regular software fees, and by taking a cut of its customers; customer payment flow.;Vertical SaaS companies are looking at how they can directly embed and bake these payments capabilities into their platform,; Serna told TechCrunch.All this fits back into the round; Finix is a bet that providing payment technology on a SaaS basis will attract legion uptake by companies of all sorts. As a deck that Finix;s Serna showed TechCrunch a few weeks ago stated, ;software companies are becoming payments companies,; and his company wants to be the engine behind that change.The betThe payments world is stuffed full of players at different points of the transaction stack, including processors, banks, card networks and payment facilitators like Lightspeed and Stripe. It;s a complex set of relationships. Serna agrees, calling the industry ;a blackbox to basically everybody; in a 2019 interview.Creating simplicity through software is something that has generally done well in the technology world in recent years. Twilio took telephony and boiled it down into APIs. Plaid did the same thing with consumer finance. Finix, it seems, wants to let anyone who takes lots of payments to be able to reduce their relationship load, control costs and perhaps drive more revenue.The startup now has the capital with which to bring its vision more fully to life, but domestically and abroad. Let;s see how far Finix can get on its new check ; and its willingness to take a small risk and share a bit more concerning its business performance in the future.",https://tcrn.ch/31tljj0

All of the company;s previous investors, including Union Square Ventures, Emergence Capital and Leaders Fund, also participated in this round, which also includes debt financing from BMO Technology and Innovation Banking Group.According to Top Hat,  about 2.7 million students are currently enrolled in courses that use its tools and schools that use its services include 750 out of the top 1,000 colleges and universities in North America.;Higher education is undergoing a sea change brought on by the massive price of a degree, combined with an economy undergoing radical transformation,; said Top Hat founder and CEO Mike Silagadze. ;This has created a demand to raise the impact of educational outcomes. With the support and confidence of our investors, customers, and employees, Top Hat will continue building on the exponential growth we’ve achieved to empower professors to work smarter and more effectively so they can improve the educational return on investment for their students.;The company, which has now raised a total of just under $105 million according to Crunchbase, plans to use the new funding to expand its efforts around digital textbooks and course materials. That;s a process the company started in 2017 when it moved beyond its quiz and feedback system for in-class use to becoming more of a platform that included textbooks and other tools for teachers and students. Today it has exclusive partnerships with textbook publishers Fountainhead Press and Bluedoor Publishing.As of last year, Top Hat is bundling its products into a single platform to provide teachers with a comprehensive set of tools for managing their classes.;As university students rebel against ridiculous textbook prices much as music consumers did in the early 2000s, Top Hat has emerged a visionary leader by bringing students and educators together in a collaborative digital teaching and learning experience that improves outcomes while reducing costs,; said Inovia Capital  partner Shawn Abbott. ;My partnership is proud to be part of the massive societal impact of building an enduring, trusted platform on which our children are being better educated, affordably.;Top Hat takes on textbook publishers with the launch of its content marketplace",https://tcrn.ch/2uhTeyS

This will include further job creation at the fintech;s Kraków offices, where 130 out of 160 total staff are currently located.Azimo has raised $50 million of equity funding to date ; investors include Rakuten, eVentures, Greycroft and Frog Capital ; and in August the company said it was profitable. It offers low-cost international payments to 200+ countries and territories around the world and claims 2 million registered customers.;[We are] planning to use the finance to scale faster in Europe,; Azimo co-founder and executive chairman Michael Kent tells TechCrunch. This will include investing in engineering and product talent, ;so we can adapt our product for ever more countries and build ever better instant payment rails;.In addition, the fintech plans to increase marketing spend and ;spread the gospel of Azimo;s faster and cheaper proposition to more customers in the EU,; says Kent.Meanwhile, Azimo securing a line of credit from the EIB is interesting in the context of Brexit. The company is very typical of European tech scale-ups that have teams split across the U.K. and continental Europe, born in part out of the U.K.;s membership of the EU and freedom of movement, which, as of this week, came to an end.Kent has already had to re-jig the business by securing an e-money license in the Netherlands in order to continue trading in Europe. And he has views on what the U.K. government needs to do next, specifically with regards to accessing European skilled labour, which he has said is the ;lifeblood of fintech.;;I have a very international team in London too and always will,; Kent tells me. ;I want to be able to keep them here and augment that team with top talent.

Leading the round is Notion Capital, with participation from existing investors Project A Ventures and SEED Capital.The Copenhagen and now London-based startup says it will use the new capital to accelerate its product development. This will including innovating with regards to the way it handles data, and further integrations with third-party software.Headcount in its product and engineering teams will also increase, and Dixa says it plans to ;double down; on its go-to-market strategy in Europe and the U.S., where the company says it is seeing strong demand. In the last two years, it has grown from 12 to 120 employees across five offices in Copenhagen, London, Berlin, Kyiv, and Lviv.Noteworthy, the Series B comes less than a year after Dixa raised a $14 million Series A, and the startup claims it didn;t need the cash. A sign of an overheated market and cheap money, perhaps? However, Dixa co-founder and CEO Mads Fosselius says it was all about investor-startup-fit based on Notion Capital;s track record investing in SaaS. The VC firm;s SaaS investments include Tradeshift, Mews, NewVoiceMedia, Paddle, Unbabel and others.Founded in 2015 by Jacob Vous Petersen and Mads Fosselius, Dixa wants to end bad customer service with the help of technology that claims to be able to facilitate more personalised customer support. Dubbed a “customer friendship” platform, the Dixa cloud-based software works across multiple channels — including phone, chat, e-mail, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and SMS — and employs a smart routing system so the right support requests reach the right people within an organisation.“The problem for customer-facing support teams today is that tickets shared in boxes and legacy call center solutions limit a brand’s ability to connect to their customers where they want to and add extra administrative burdens that ultimately harms the customer experience,” co-founder and CEO Mads Fosselius told me when the company raised its Series A.More broadly, the platform competes with Zendesk, Freshdesk and Salesforce Servicecloud. However, Fosselius says that Dixa provides a more ;holistic and data-driven customer and agent experience.;Adds Jos White, General Partner at Notion: “Customer service is one of the largest software categories out there, and yet the market is still operating in transactional silos and not reflecting the world we live in.

Direct listings have been an awfully hot topic as of late, seen as a means of reducing the friction and expenses of going public. Slack debuted publicly via a direct listing in 2019 and Spotify did the same the year before. Airbnb has also reportedly expressed interest in a direct listing.Asana, co-founded by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and Justin Rosenstein, builds productivity software that allows teams to assign tasks, track progress and set deadlines for projects.Direct listings have been lauded by many in Silicon Valley as a way to strip from the process the steep bank underwriting fees, lengthy roadshows and some regulatory hoops. Last year, venture capitalist Bill Gurley hosted a one-day conference devoted to preaching the gospel of direct listings. The New York Stock Exchange filed paperwork in November to the SEC, hoping to expand direct listings and allow companies pursuing them to raise new capital during the process. The proposal was rejected weeks later, though the NYSE seems determined to double down on efforts to evolve the direct listing process.Asana is interestingly a much smaller company than Slack or Spotify, and has raised much less capital. The startup has raised about $213 million according to Crunchbase. In late 2018, Asana raised a $50 million Series E at a $1.5 billion valuation. Debuting via a public listing suggests that the company may be satisfied with the cash it has on hand.Is a direct listing the right choice for your company?",https://tcrn.ch/36VsMsf

One focus has been the relentless communication between companies and customers that takes place at call centers.Call center tech has spawned dozens if not hundreds of AI startups, many of which have focused on automating services and using robotic voices to point customers somewhere they can spend money. There has been a lot of progress, but not all of those products have delivered. Cresta is more focused on using AI suggestions to help human contact center workers make the most of an individual call or chat session and lean on what;s worked well for past interactions that were deemed successful.;I think that there will always be very basic boring stuff that can be automated like frequently asked questions and ;Oh, what;s the status of my order?,; ; CEO Zayd Enam says. ;But there;s always the role of the person that;s building the relationship between the company and the customer, and that;s a really strategic role for companies in the modern age.;Udacity co-founder Sebastian Thrun  is the startup;s board chairman and is listed as a co-founder. Enam met Thrun during his PhD research at Stanford focused on workplace productivity. Cresta is launching from stealth and announcing that they;ve raised $21 million in funding from investors including Greylock Partners and Andreessen Horowitz. The company recently closed a $15 million Series A round.Cresta  wants to use AI to school customer service workers and salespeople on how to close the deal.There;s quite a lot of turnover in contact center jobs and that can leave companies reticent to spend a ton of time investing in each employee;s training. Naturally, there are some inherent issues where the workers interacting with an individual customer might not have the experience necessary to suggest a solution that they might if they had more experience. In terms of live feedback, for many, fumbling through paper scripts at their desk can be about as good as it gets. Cresta is hoping that by tapping improvements in natural language processing, their software can help alleviate some stress for contact center workers and help them move conversations in the direction of selling something else for their company.Cresta is entering a field where there;s already quite a bit of interest from established software giants. Salesforce, Google and Twilio all operate AI-driven products for contact centers. Even with substantial competition, Enam believes Cresta;s team of 30 can offer its customers a lot more individual attention.;We;re one of the few technical teams where we;re just obsessed with the customer, to the point where it;s normal for people on our team to fly to the customer and live by a call center in an Airbnb for a week,; Enam said. ;When Greylock led the Series A, they had heard that and said that;s what gave them so much conviction that we were the team to solve the problem.;Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim, Mark Leslie and Vivi Nevo are also investors in Cresta.",https://tcrn.ch/31rw84T

The companies did not share the acquisition price.Specifically, Scytale looks at application-to-application identity and access management, something that is increasingly important as more transactions take place between applications without any human intervention. It;s imperative that the application knows it;s OK to share information with the other application.This is an area that HPE wants to expand into, Dave Husak, HPE fellow and GM of cloudless initiative wrote in a blog post announcing the acquisition. ;As HPE progresses into this next chapter, delivering on our differentiated, edge to cloud platform as-a-service strategy, security will continue to play a fundamental role. We recognize that every organization that operates in a hybrid, multi-cloud environment requires 100% secure, zero trust systems, that can dynamically identify and authenticate data and applications in real-time,; Husak wrote.He also was careful to stress that HPE would continue to be good stewards of the SPIFFE and SPIRE (the SPIFFE Runtime Environment) projects, both of which are under the auspices of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.Scytale co-founder Sunil James, writing in a blog post about the deal, indicated that this was important to the founders that HPE respect the startup;s open-source roots. ;Scytale;s DNA is security, distributed systems, and open-source. Under HPE, Scytale will continue to help steward SPIFFE. Our ever-growing and vocal community will lead us. We;ll toil to maintain this transparent and vendor-neutral project, which will be fundamental in HPE;s plans to deliver a dynamic, open, and secure edge-to-cloud platform,; he wrote.Scytale was founded in 2017 and had raised $8 million, according to PitchBook data.

1941144,2020-02-03T13:07:49,Jenfi wants to solve small business lending in Southeast Asia,"Small business lending is a huge market that has attracted massive attention from VC investors in recent years. Startups like Kabbage have raised more than a billion dollars in venture capital and debt to create lending platforms for businesses, and others in the space like Fundbox for lending and BlueVine for banking are trying to build new, digital-first models for helping SMB owners grow their businesses.While startups targeting the U.S. and European markets have proliferated, other international markets have seen less attention. Portal Finance raised $200 million to help businesses with lending in Latin America, and First Circle raised a $26 million round to do the same in the Philippines.Lending startup Portal Finance nabs $200 million for small business loans in Latin AmericaNow Jenfi wants to enter the mix. The company, founded by Jeffrey Liu, who sold his past startup GuavaPass to ClassPass for a few million, and Justin Louie, who was one of the first employees at GuavaPass, wants to expand access to small and medium business loans for owners in Southeast Asia, starting with their first base of operations in Singapore.Fitness marketplace ClassPass acquires competitor GuavaPass“Even in a market like Singapore which is quite well-established … half of these companies are still underbanked, [and] they don’t have access to credit,” Liu explained to me in an interview. “We realized there was a big problem there.”The company raised a US$1 million angel round of debt and equity, and is currently going through YC’s accelerator program. So far, the startup has 50 borrowers on its platform according to Liu, and has lent SGD$600,000 so far since launch last year.In terms of its product, the company either lends directly to a small business, or offers a virtual Jenfi Mastercard that can be used for purchases.What’s more interesting right now, though, is Jenfi’s model, which is something that you don’t see all the time in the lending space. The company is approaching SMB lending purely from a growth perspective. The startup wants to help owners invest in the growth of their businesses primarily through digital marketing, and takes a small percentage of future revenue in lieu of a fixed repayment schedule.Liu says that “part of the value-add is that we can help them be more effective in their alternative marketing channels…” He said that the startup doesn’t want to become a service provider, but has been building partnerships with other marketing agencies and services that can help owners find the right growth strategies for them, and then execute on them funded by Jenfi capital. “Our goal is to be able to build a network,” Liu says. “Marketing growth is our initial product focus for this company.”The timing could be propitious. A study by Google and Bain late last year pegged Southeast Asia as a massive opportunity for digital services, with deep smartphone penetration but still a relatively limited array of digital services across a range of categories. Online marketing channels exist, but are under-optimized, particularly in comparison to the large sums devoted to them in countries like the U.S.Over the next two years, Liu and Louie hope to expand to more geographies, build out their product offering and continually build long-term partnerships with business owners.",https://tcrn.ch/2uZghhR

That said, two-thirds of America;s 50 million seniors use the internet and more than 40% own a smartphone, according to a 2017 Pew study.So where;s the disconnect? Why are modern software companies largely non-compatible with one of the nation;s largest demographics?Starting with day-to-day careThe most notorious venture-funded elder tech startups were historically focused on building better healthcare and day-to-day living solutions. Honor built a managed marketplace for in-home care; YC startup GoGoGrandparent is Uber for people who don;t use apps; Umbrella* helps seniors get tasks done around the house.The concept behind these companies is that daily basics are the root of other problems affecting seniors. If you have any issues with your home or mobility, for example, you end up exposing yourself to scams that frequently plague seniors, as well as health and safety risks. That;s not to mention the financial burden — most retirees have a modest budget or fixed income. Even if a service like TaskRabbit is somehow accessible to a senior, it;s not affordable in the long-term when lifespans and future costs are impossible to predict.",https://tcrn.ch/2Oo1B2I

By integrating their Solaborate device with Smart TVs, the entrepreneurs have come up with a drastically cheaper device and platform.Solaborate  has now closed a $10 million Series A funding round from EPOS and Demant Group. EPOS is a newly established company under the healthcare tech company Demant Group in Denmark, which makes high-end audio solutions designed for enterprise and gaming. The funding will be used to accelerate the development of Solaborate;s new product line of all-in-one HELLO devices and its cloud communication platform.After two successful Kickstarter campaigns, Solaborate will now work with EPOS to combine compute, microphones, speakers and Smart TVs with their technology to create products fully owned by and branded under EPOS.

1940525,2020-02-03T08:12:19,What robotics’ biggest raises tell us about the industry’s future,"I visited Boston last week and met with a number of robotics researchers, startups and established companies — more on that later — in the lead up to TechCrunch’s fourth annual TC Sessions Robotics + AI in early March. A big part of prepping for that event and my recent trip involved surveying some of the biggest funding raises from the past year. A quick survey of these trends finds most investments concentrated in a handful of key categories. From there, we can get a pretty clear view of what the robotics industry will look like in the coming years and the roles we can expect these machines to play in our daily lives. The definition of robotics is, of course, broad and only getting broader, as these technologies grow and mature. It’s worth noting that for the sake of my own research, I’ve mostly excluded autonomous driving — one of the key targets of robotics investment. It is, perhaps, an arbitrary distinction that has more to do with the way we categorize technologies — placing them in automotive or mobility, as opposed to robotics.Artificial intelligence startups, too, are included sparingly for similar reasons. With those caveats in mind, these verticals have been the key focuses of robotics investments: warehouse automation/fulfillment, construction, retail/food, agriculture and surgical/medical.",https://tcrn.ch/2OmddmE
1940870,2020-02-03T07:20:55,"Rocket startup Astra emerges from stealth, aims to launch for as little as $1M per flight","There;s yet another new rocket launch startup throwing its hat in the ring ; Astra,  an Alameda-based company that;s actually been operating in stealth mode (though relatively openly, often referred to as ;Stealth Space Company;) for the past three years developing and testing its launch vehicle. Astra revealed its business model and progress to date in a new feature article with Bloomberg Businessweek, detailing how it plans to use mass production to deliver rockets quickly and cheaply for small satellite orbital delivery. Astra revealed it has raised more than $100 million from investors, including Eric Schmidt;s Innovation Endeavors, Airbus Ventures, Canann Partners and Salesforce co-founder Marc Benioff, to name a few, and it has big ambitions in terms of cost and capabilities.Astra;s rockets are smaller than most existing launch vehicles in operation, designed to delivery up to 450 lbs of cargo to space, but with the specific mandate of doing so quickly and responsively. The company is a finalist (and the only remaining one) on Darpa;s Launch Challenge, the terms of which mandate that the winning company deploy two rockets from two different locations within a few weeks of each other. Astra is still in the running, while its erstwhile competitors have dropped out, with Virgin Orbit having voluntarily withdrawn and Vector Launch  having gone out of business.The Darpa challenge, which includes an award of $12 million for the winner, represents a growing trend in terms of defense customer needs: Fast turnaround and responsive operations for small satellite delivery. In an industry where the process of securing a launch service provider to actually flying a payload has typically taken at least six months in the best-case scenario, there;s a growing need for quicker timelines in the interest of building more redundancy and resilience into defense and reconnaissance space operations through use of networks of small satellites, versus single large geostationary satellites that are expensive to launch and more time-consuming to task.Astra, led by serial entrepreneur and former NASA CTO Chris Kemp,  wants to address this growing demand (which extends to commercial customers like Spire, Planet and others that are putting up large communications and Earth observation small satellite constellations) by producing rockets fast and with high frequency. Per the Bloomberg article, Astra says it can launch ;profitably; for $2.5 million per mission, which is around half the going rate for a Rocket Lab launch, and that it eventually hopes to attain costs as low as $1 million per mission with a daily launch operational cadence. To that end, it;s looking to ramp production to a rate of producing hundreds of vehicles per year in a 250,000-square-foot manufacturing facility it;s setting up.Astra is also different in that it;s using aluminum primarily in its launch vehicle, as opposed to the more costly but premium carbon fiber used by Rocket Lab  in its Electron vehicle. And their launch platform is designed with mobility in mind, as the whole point is that it can be deployed responsively and globally on short notice. If Rocket Lab;s launcher is a finely crafted and engineered supercar, Astra;s is aiming to be a reliable, adequate daily compact commuter car.Next up for Astra in terms of key milestones is a launch planned for February 21 from Kodiak, Alaska ; an island spaceport owned and operated by Alaska Aerospace.

1940911,2020-02-03T07:13:18,Construction startup Scaled Robotics raises a €2M seed round,"Industrial robots are expensive. But, then, so are construction mistakes. Being off by an inch here or there adds up quickly, and too often crews need to correct costly errors. There’s a reason construction has become the next great target of the robotics and automation industries, with a number of startups vying to create solutions that can constantly monitor sites to detect mistakes before it’s too late.TechCrunch’s Disrupt Berlin Battlefield winner Scaled Robotics this week is among the early-stage startups tackling the problem. This morning, the small Barcelona-based construction startup announced that it has raised a €2 million seed investment, led by European firms Norwegian Construct Venture and PropTech Fund Surplus. The funding follows a €1 million pre-seed.Scaled Robotics keeps an autonomous eye on busy construction sitesConstruction has become one of the key focuses of robotics investments in recent years, with names like Built, Toggle and Dusty raising rounds in the last year or so. Even Boston Dynamics is looking to get into the act, mounting lidar sensors to the top of its Spot robots, with construction listed as one of the primary use case for the commercialized version of the product. Scaled’s robot is low to the ground, with four-wheels. Mounted up top are lasers and cameras that use SLAM technology to essentially build a 3D point map of a space. The map is then compared to a construction model of the space, and differences can be noted down to the centimeter. The robot;s mobility saves construction workers from having to lug around a tripod, as is the case with standard stationary laser scanners. “The tools being developed by Scaled Robotics not only provide a detailed analysis of the state of a construction project but also provide a centralized repository for all information relating to project quality and progress,” co-founder and CEO Stuart Maggs said in a release tied to the funding. “We envision that our products will allow this global $13 trillion industry to manage risk and uncertainty in ways that were previously impossible. We are very pleased to have Surplus Invest and Construct Venture on the team, both investors who share our vision of changing the industry through a combination of robotics and artificial intelligence.”",https://tcrn.ch/2UnQyKG

The goal? To become every bit as notable as a16z or Sequoia Capital.Qualtrics co-founder Ryan Smith and Domo and Omniture founder Josh James onstage at the Silicon Slopes Tech Summit.;I grew up in the Bay Area,; Kearl told TechCrunch  of the energy he feels in the state. ;This feels like the 1990s in the Bay Area. You can find hundreds of open jobs up and down the Wasatch Front.;Utah has a reputation as a mostly religious, conservative and sleepy mountain region for outdoors enthusiasts, but tech has fast become the leading job sector in the state, with some salaries from companies like Adobe and Qualtrics rivaling those in Silicon Valley. The state recently pledged a push to include at least one computer science course in every high school in the state by 2022. It also just hosted a massive, 25,000 person startup festival called the Silicon Slopes Tech Summit. The summit held a Utah state governor;s debate and both Steve Case and Mark Zuckerberg spoke on stage.It;s unclear how much the fund has set aside for its mission to help Utah become a full-fledged tech ecosystem rivaling Silicon Valley but one would imagine it would have a sizable sum to invest, if, as Smith tells TechCrunch, it is to help Utah;s up-and-coming startups go all the way from seed stage to IPO.;I want to see companies get even bigger than Qualtrics; and do it in this state,; Smith said. Qualtrics sold to SAP  in 2019 for $8 billion, notably the largest private enterprise software deal in tech history.Silicon Slopes Tech Summit 2020 Gubernatorial DebateOne of the many issues tech hubs around the world face is both the networking capabilities and the ability to invest after the early stage investment. Most startups throughout the globe still find the need to travel and make connections in Silicon Valley to get them through the next step of growth. This has been true for every billion-dollar startup idea in Utah as well so far. Both Smith and James took in Silicon Valley venture for their companies, as did unicorn turned public edtech startup Pluralsight  and the recently rebranded sales platform Xant (formerly InsideSales) before making it big.However, this new fund represents the kind of push needed to create a strong innovation ecosystem in the future, as Steve Case  mentioned on stage at the summit event this last week. ;Venture capitalists must look at ;what’s happening in the Silicon Slopes; and make sure it ;is happening other places;,” Utah newspaper Deseret News paraphrased the AOL founder as saying.Pelion Venture Partners,  which operates in both Utah and Southern California, will act as a support to Silicon Slopes Venture Fund, providing organizational overhead. Each partner will still keep their day job and donate most fees to support the ongoing operation of the non-profit tech organization, Silicon Slopes, which runs the annual tech summit of the same moniker. However, the Silicon Slopes Venture Fund will be an independent fund from Pelion, with the sole purpose of investing in deal flow the three partners find through their respective networks within the state.;I used to hate the term ;a rising tide lifts all boats; because I want to be the only boat,; James told TechCrunch. ;But I really think it applies here for what we are trying to do [in Utah].;",https://tcrn.ch/2SadsT4
1940846,2020-02-03T05:35:50,Launch startup Skyrora successfully tests 3D-printed rocket engines powered by plastic waste,"Rocket launch startup Skyrora, an Edinburgh-based company that;s developing a new launch vehicle for small satellites, has successfully tested its new rocket engines in their first stationary ground-firings, a huge step on the way toward developing their launch vehicle. Skyrora;s rocket engines are novel not only in their use of 3D printing, but also because the fuel that powers them is developed from plastic waste — a new type of fuel called ;Ecosene; the startup says makes its launch vehicles greener and more ecologically sound than the competition.The rocket engine that Skyrora is testing will eventually power the final stage of its 22-meter (72-foot) Skyrora XL launch vehicle (closer to Rocket Lab;s  Electron at 57 feet than SpaceX;s  Falcon 9 at 229 feet), which will be capable of delivering multiple payloads to separate orbits ranging up to 500 km (310 miles) above Earth, a popular low-Earth orbit target range for small satellite payloads. Skyrora fired the engines both with its Ecosene fuel, which is its kerosene directed from waste plastics using a proprietary process, and with traditional kerosene RP-1 rocket fuel, giving the company the opportunity to compare the two fuel sources in terms of performance.Skyrora says it can create around 600 kg (1,300 lbs) of kerosene form 1,000 kg (2,200 lbs) of plastic waste, and its fuel results in around 45% less greenhouse gas emissions. The Ecosene also has the advantage of not requiring cryogenic freezing, and it can be stored in tanks for long periods of time, something that the startup says helps it work particularly well for launch conditions from the Scottish spaceport from which the company plans to launch.Ultimately, this is just one test on the path to validation and eventual launch, but Skyrora is encouraged by the results of this test, and it plans to fly its first Skyrora XL vehicles from its U.K.-based launch site starting in 2022.TechCrunch is hosting its first ever dedicated space event in 2020 – TechCrunch Sessions: Space, happening June 25 in LA.

He is focused on investments at Seed and Series A.			It’s a somewhat crude yardstick by which to measure innovation in deep tech — and the result perhaps reflects historic bias as much as it does actual leadership in innovation — but Europe leads every other continental region when it comes to the number of Nobel laureates it has produced in chemistry, medicine and physics.These three categories are most closely associated with what we classify as deep tech: startups that don;t merely apply a technology layer or wrapper to an existing product, service or business model, but rather push forward ideas based on substantial, R&amp;D-intensive and IP-protected, scientific advances and high-tech engineering innovation.These advances — and the startups turning them into businesses — often originate from university research teams. On this front, Europe also leads the way as home to the two top-ranked universities in the world for quality of research, the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Another European institution, ETH Zurich, rounds out the top 10.However, if you rank universities around the world by the amount of venture capital investment secured by startups founded by their graduates, the top of the table takes on a distinctly American flavor, with Stanford (fourth in the research quality ranking) taking top spot ahead of eight other U.S. universities in the top 10 (including several that do not feature in the top 10 of the research quality ranking). Tel Aviv University is the sole European (depending on your definition) representative in the top 10 ranked by funding for spin-outs.",https://tcrn.ch/3b9IB1x
1940831,2020-02-03T03:20:49,Japanese vacation rental management startup H2O raises $7 million Series B from investors including Samsung Ventures,"Japan’s tourism industry is booming, but it faces a hotel room shortage, especially in Tokyo as the country prepares for the Summer Olympics. H2O (the name stands for Hospitality 2.0) addresses the market opportunity with a platform that helps vacation rental owners manage their properties. The startup announced today it has raised $7 million in Series B funding from Samsung Ventures, Stonebridge Ventures, IMM Investment and Shinhan Capital, bringing its total raised to $18 million.H2O allows owners to manage operations, housekeeping and bookings from different online travel agencies on its platform, lowering the cost of doing business. The company also recently launched H2O, a vacation rental brand, to expand its real estate development business, including a new hotel near Universal Studio Japan.The company began in 2015 with Wahome in South Korea, a home cleaning service, before launching H2O two years later after acquiring several hospitality management companies in Japan, including a housekeeping service for vacation rentals. There are currently about 5,000 managed rooms connected to the platform, which is used by about 25 online travel agencies. Since the third-quarter of 2018, revenue has doubled every quarter, says founder and CEO John Lee.Lee, who studied hotel administration at Cornell University and previously worked in banking at Morgan Stanley, told TechCrunch in an email that there were three market trends that made launching a hospitality business in Japan compelling:Strong domestic tourism.Increasing inbound tourism.A huge shortage in accommodations.H20 first focused on allowing flexible housekeeping bookings for vacation rental properties. Then in 2018, H2O expanded to full hospitality management services, including property, yield, revenue and operations.Lee said he believes “the core value of the hospitality industry is how to increase the yield of the real estate. I always believed that managing one building with high fixed costs (front desk, housekeeping department, etc.) was very inefficient from building owners point of view.”H2O’s property management system works by syncing three calendars: guests, rooms and housekeeping. All are linked and automated to prevent double bookings and make sure housecleaning services are available. This allows H2O’s software to manage revenue, inventory and yield on a per-droom basis and schedule guests and cleanings.The platform also allows clients to manage multiple properties at once and offer smart locks, online check-ins and chat-based customer service.In June 2019, Japan implemented the Housing and Accommodations Business Act (also called the minpaku law, after the Japanese term for private residences rented out as short-term accommodations, similar to properties on AirBnb), formally legalizing and regulating vacation rental management. Lee says the new regulation allowed more real estate investors, who already owned other types of hospitality properties, to enter the minpaku market. H2O manages properties under four licenses, including hotel, ryokan and kanishokuksho, but the majority of its properties are under the minpaku law, which allowed it to grow its B2B business.The average daily rate for accommodations on H2O was around $160 in 2019, with an average occupancy rate of 87 percent. Of the property owners who use H2O, 70 percent are real estate property managers, 20 percent are local property owners and 10 percent are overseas real estate funds. About 60 percent of guests who use H2O to book accommodations are inbound travelers (of that number, 40 percent are from China, 40 percent are from Southeast Asia, 10 percent are from South Korea and 10 percent are from other countries), while the rest are domestic tourists.In press statement, Eric Kim, senior investment manager at Samsung Ventures, said “We’re pleased to be part of the fastest-growing hospitality company in Japan. H2O has already proven product market fit within Japan, and we expect them to continue to thrive as they expand outside of major cities.”",https://tcrn.ch/3b5Hdgl
1939839,2020-02-02T09:33:13,The case for cooperative tech startups,"When Uber and Lyft went public, it wasn;t the drivers who got rich — it was the executives, investors and some early employees. In an era when it has become clear that tech executives and investors are frequently the only ones who;ll reap rewards for a company;s success, cooperative startups are getting more attention.Depending on how it;s set up, a cooperative model offers workers and users true ownership and control in a company; any profits that are generated are returned to the members or reinvested in the company.Co-ops aren;t new: The nation;s longest-running example is The Philadelphia Contributionship, a mutually owned insurance company founded by Benjamin Franklin in 1752. In 1895, the International Co-operative Alliance formed to serve as a way to unite cooperatives across the world. Some colleges have student-run housing co-ops where cleaning, food preparation and other responsibilities are shared. Today, there are many well-known large-scale co-ops, including outdoor recreation store REI, Arizmendi Bakery in San Francisco and Blue Diamond Growers, one of the world;s largest tree-nut processors.What;s novel, however, is applying the co-op model to technology startups. Start.coop, an accelerator for cooperative startups, is just one group trying to facilitate that practice.",https://tcrn.ch/2GLVpgH

More posts by this contributor								;Capitalism generates a lot of wealth depending on the situation;						Justin Kan opens up (Part 2)							Justin Kan was talking about the systems in his life. The serial entrepreneur/founder, who recently announced a pivot and significant layoffs at Atrium, his latest venture, came to speak at last fall’s TechCrunch Disrupt in high-fashion black sweats and an extremely colorful pair of Nikes.After Kan wrapped up his panel, we sat down for a wide-ranging and philosophical interview. And as we left off in part one of our conversation, Kan was explaining his self-described Buddhist philosophy of life.But in the second part of our interview, I wanted to focus more on Kan’s thoughts about systems in society as a whole. There’s a difference, after all, between working mindfully to change oneself and doing so to change society. As we’ve seen with Adam Neumann,  among others, there is a certain class of “spiritual” Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who use their platform in tech to assuage their own inner suffering — and perhaps gain influence by helping similarly influential people alleviate their own. WeWork, for example, cultivated associations with everything from Kabbalah to Deepak Chopra to mindful eating before the company melted under the heat of its own ethical challenges.I don’t know that there is evidence to place Kan in the above category; maybe he is better understood as a legitimate, if unconventional, Big Thinker. But either way, it would be important to ask: What good is it when tech leaders like Kan seek a Buddhist alleviation of suffering, if the industries that sustain them are, at scale, currently creating enormous and very tangible suffering for countless millions of less fortunate people?",https://tcrn.ch/3b0Aftj
1940738,2020-02-01T18:33:50,Report: WeWork has a new CEO and he;s a real estate ; not a tech ; exec,"If WeWork  wanted to cement the impression that it no longer strives to be viewed as a tech company but rather as a real estate giant focused on leasing space, it would probably choose a veteran from the real estate world.That;s just what it has done, too, according to a new story from the WSJ that says the company, which was famously forced to pull its initial public offering last fall, has settled on Sandeep Mathrani as its new top banana.Mathrani has spent the last 1.5 years as the CEO of Brookfield Properties; retail group and as a vice chairman of Brookfield Properties. Before joining the Chicago-based company, he spent eight years as the CEO of General Growth Properties. It was one of the largest mall operators in the U.S. until Brookfield acquired it for $9.25 billion in cash in 2018.Mathrani also spent eight years as an executive vice president with Vornado Realty Trust, a publicly traded real estate company with a market cap of $12.5 billion. (Brookfield is slightly smaller, with a market cap of roughly $8 billion.)Mathrani will reportedly relocate to New York from Miami, where, according to public records, he owns at least one high-rise apartment that he acquired last year.He;ll be reporting to Marcelo Claure, the SoftBank  operating chief who was appointed executive chairman of WeWork in October in order to help salvage what Claure has himself said is an $18.5 billion bet on WeWork by SoftBank.Specifically, Claure told nervous employees at an all-hands meeting shortly after his appointment, ;The size of the commitment that SoftBank has made to this company in the past and now is $18.5 billion. To put the things in context, that is bigger than the GDP of my country where I came from [Bolivia]. That’s a country where there’s 11 million people.”Claure ; who earlier spent four years as the CEO of SoftBank-backed Sprint ; was reportedly trying to hire T-Mobile CEO John Legere for the CEO;s post. Legere later communicated through sources that he had no plans to leave T-Mobile, yet just days later, in mid-November, Legere, who joined T-Mobile in 2012, announced that he;s stepping down as CEO after all, though he will remain chairman of the company. (According to the Verge, his contract is up April 30.)Sprint and T-Mobile were expected to merge, though 13 states, led by the attorneys general of New York and California, are suing to block the deal over concerns that the merger would hurt competition and raise prices for users; cell service.Either way, Mathrani is a stark contrast to WeWork;s co-founder and longtime CEO Adam Neumann,  who was pressured to resign from the company after his sweeping vision for it as a tech company that enables customers to seamlessly shift from one WeWork location to another while also paying for software and services was met with extreme skepticism by public market investors.Indeed, though SoftBank marked up the company;s value over a number of private funding rounds ; all the way to a brow-raising $47 billion ; public investors began raising questions about its real value, and WeWork;s governance, as soon as WeWork publicly released the paperwork for its initial public offering.Between the in-depth look its S-1 provided into the company;s spiraling losses; the degree of control held by Neumann (not fully understood previously); and a series of unflattering reports about his leadership style, including beginning with the WSJ; it didn;t take long before the company was forced to abandon its IPO dreams.No doubt it;s now Mathrani;s job to eventually resuscitate those.According to the WSJ, SoftBank has already established a five-year business plan that it expects will get the company to profitability and allow it to be cash-flow positive by some time next year. Part of that plan clearly involved layoffs; it cut 2,400 employees in late November, shortly before the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S. It has also been selling off companies that were acquired at Neumann;s direction but are seen as non-core assets. What WeWork does not intend to curtail, reportedly, are its efforts to open new locations, even if it acquires them at a slower pace than in previous years.",https://tcrn.ch/2OkRSKF

That;s the initial takeaway Alex Wilhelm has after One Medical;s successful debut this week. One might think it looks like a tech-enabled unicorn, that doesn;t generate the recurring revenue and margins of a true tech-powered business.But, the doctor-services provider closed up almost 40% on a somewhat ambitious price of $14 per share. It had raised $532.1 million during its time as a private company, with a fairly recent valuation of $1.71 billion. With its closing value of $19.50 per share today, One Medical is now worth $2.38 billion.That;s despite gross margins under the 50% mark, deeply minority recurring revenue and 30% revenue growth in 2019 at best, as Alex noted on Extra Crunch Friday. It is now worth about 8.5x its trailing revenues.;There are cash-generating SaaS companies that are growing only a bit more slowly that are trading for lower multiples,; he has previously observed. ;I cannot see what makes the company — an unprofitable, only moderately growing upstart with non-recurring revenue — worth a SaaS multiple. Especially as its gross margins aren’t great and aren’t improving.;Meanwhile, mattress-seller Casper, which also filed new information about its IPO plans this week, has numbers that aren;t all that different. But it;s just hoping to not take too big of a haircut on its last private valuation, Alex separately noted on EC.Maybe public investors still care about a great story, despite the rough debuts of Blue Apron, SmileDirect, WeWork and a range of others? Certainly, One Medical;s work to improve medical care is laudable regardless of these questions (in fact, it won the Best Healthcare Startup Crunchie in 2013).Stay tuned for more.How acquirers look at your companyLet;s say the public markets are not for you, though, and instead you want to get acquired. Ed Byrne of Scaleworks looks at this both as a startup investor and, through a separate part of his company, as an acquirer, and has kindly provided a detailed explainer on Extra Crunch for startup founders.Here are his key deciders from the purchaser perspective:Downside protection: Are we confident we are not going to lose money?Median: If we work hard, focus on good business operations and execute the low-hanging fruit, will we be able to grow this business enough to make a solid return (solid return being an increased valuation multiple from a higher revenue base)?Upside: If one of our category creation ideas pans out, and we succeed in winning a very targeted segment of the market, is there an opportunity for this business to be a real winner and provide outsized returns?Buying and taking on someone else’s business is always a scary proposition — the unknown unknowns — but if you get comfortable with the fundamental of the company, acquisitions can be a real accelerator compared to the epic effort — and high risk — of starting from scratch.Where top VCs are investing in travel, tourism and hospitality techWant to build the next Airbnb?

And I think that’s really encouraged a new next generation of entrepreneur. And Europe is changing its mindset that it’s okay to fail.And I think the other shift is that now people are saying, “okay, well, I’m not going to move to the valley and trying to build my teams because talent is so competitive and so expensive over there, I want to build in Europe.” And then finally, the great engineering, design, product talent here and then being helped by funds like us to scale it at the beginning and early stages, and then going on to produce some really interesting things. I don’t think U.S. funds are coming over here because they see cheaper pricing and lower valuations.

Justin Kan  is a serial entrepreneur and founder who, whether you appreciate his public voice or not, certainly stands out as one of the most interesting examples of that classic Silicon Valley archetype: a tech entrepreneur ostensibly doing much more than just selling technology.Kan famously started his business career not long after he graduated from Yale in 2005 by creating Justin.tv, a tech platform from which he broadcast his own life 24/7. Fifteen years later, Kan’s original idea seems quaint, given the level of self-promotion and oversharing that;s become commonplace.

Online commerce  accounted for nearly $518 billion in revenue in the United States alone last year. The growing number of online marketplaces like Amazon and eBay will command 40% of the global retail market in 2020. As the number of digital offerings — not only marketplaces but also online storefronts and company websites — available to consumers continues to grow, the primary challenge for any online platform lies in setting itself apart.The central question for how to accomplish this: Where does differentiation matter most?A customer’s ability to easily (and accurately) find a specific product or service with minimal barriers helps ensure they feel satisfied and confident with their choice of purchase. This ultimately becomes the differentiator that sets an online platform apart. It’s about coupling a stellar product with an exceptional experience. Often, that takes the form of simple, searchable access to a wide variety of products and services. Sometimes, it’s about surfacing a brand that meets an individual consumer’s needs or price point. In both cases, platforms are in a position to help customers avoid having to chase down a product or service through multiple clicks while offering a better way of comparing apples to apples.To be successful, a company should adopt a consumer-first philosophy that informs its product ideation and development process. A successful consumer-first development resides in a company’s ability to expediently deliver fresh features that customers actually respond to, rather than prioritize the update that seems most profitable.

Our biggest question was how Legacy and similar startups convince men ; who are generally less concerned with their fertility than women ; that they need the company;s at-home testing kits and services in the first place.;They should be worried about [their fertility],; said Kteily, a former healthcare and life sciences consultant with a master;s degree in public policy from the Harvard Kennedy School. ;Sperm counts have gone down 50 to 60% over the last 40 years.; More from our chat with Legacy, a former TechCrunch Battlefield winner, follows; it has been edited lightly for length.TC: Why start this company?KK: I didn;t grow up wanting to be the king of sperm [laughs]. But I had a pretty bad accident ; a second-degree burn on my legs after having four hot Starbucks teas spill on my lap in a car ; and between that and a colleague at the Kennedy School who;d been diagnosed with cancer and whose doctor suggested he freeze his sperm ahead of his radiation treatments, it just clicked for me that maybe I should also save my sperm. When I went into Cambridge to do this, the place was right next to the restaurant Dumpling House and it was just very awkward and expensive and I thought, there must be a better way of doing this.TC: How do you get started on something like this?KK: This was before Ro and Hims began taking off, but people were increasingly comfortable doing things from their own homes, so I started doing research around the idea. I joined the American Society of Reproductive Medicine. I started taking continuing education classes about sperm;TC: Women are under so much pressure from the time they turn 30 to monitor their fertility. Aside from extreme circumstances, as with your friend, do men really think about testing their sperm? KK: Men should be worried about it, and they should be taking responsibility for it. What a lot of folks don;t know is for every one in seven couples that are actively trying to get pregnant, the man is equally responsible [for their fertility struggles]. Women are taught about their fertility but men aren;t, yet the quality of their sperm is degrading over the years. Sperm counts have gone down by 50 to 60% over the last 40 years, too.TC: Wait, what? Why?KK: [Likely culprits are] chemicals in plastics, chemicals in what we eat and drink, changes in lifestyle; we move less and eat more, and sperm health relates to overall health. I also think mobile phones are causing it. I will caveat this by saying there;s been mixed research, but I;m convinced that cell phones are the new smoking in that it wasn;t clear that smoking was as dangerous as it is when the research was being conducted by companies that benefited by [perpetuating cigarette use]. There;s also a generational decline in sperm quality [to consider]; it poses increased risk to the mother but also the child, as the risk of gestational diabetes goes up, as well as the rate of autism and other congenital conditions.TC: You;re selling directly to consumers. Are you also working with companies to incorporate your tests in their overall wellness offerings?KK: We;re investing heavily in business-to-business and expect that to be a huge acquisition channel for us. We can;t share any names yet, but we just signed a big company last week and have a few more in the works. These are mostly Bay Area companies right now; it;s an area where our experience as a YC alum was valuable because of the founders who;ve gone through and now run large companies of their own.TC: When you;re talking with investors, how do you describe the market size? KK: There are four million couples that are facing fertility challenges and in all cases, we believe the man should be tested. So do [their significant others]. Almost half of purchases [of our kits] are by a female partner. We also see men in the military freezing their sperm before being deployed, same-sex couples who plan to use a surrogate at some point and transgender patients who are looking at a life-changing [moment] and want to preserve their fertility before they start the process. But we see this as something that every man might do as they go off to college, and investors see that bigger picture.TC: How much do the kits and storage cost?KK: The kit costs $195 up front, and if they choose to store their sperm, $145 a year. We offer different packages. You can also spend $1,995 for two deposits and 10 years of storage.TC: Is one or two samples effective? According to the Mayo Clinic, sperm counts fluctuate meaningfully from one sample to the next, so they suggest semen analysis tests over a period of time to ensure accurate results.KK: We encourage our clients to make multiple deposits. The scores will be variable, but they;ll gather around an average.TC: But they are charged for these deposits separately?KK: Yes.TC: And what are you looking for?KK: Volume, count, concentration, motility and morphology [meaning the shape of the sperm].TC: Who, exactly, is doing the analysis and handling the storage?KK: We partner with Andrology Labs in Chicago on analysis; it;s one of the top fertility labs in the country. For storage, we partner with a couple of cryo-storage providers in different geographies. We divide the samples into four, then store them in two different tanks within each of two locations. We want to make sure we;re never in a position where [the samples are accidentally destroyed, as has happened at clinics elsewhere].TC: I can imagine fears about these samples being mishandled. How can you assure customers this won;t happen?KK: Trust and legitimacy are core factors and a huge area of focus for us. We;re CPPA and HIPAA compliant. All [related data] is encrypted and anonymized and every customer receives a unique ID [which is a series of digits so that even the storage facilities don;t know whose sperm they are handling]. We have extreme redundancies and processes in place to ensure that we;re handling [samples] in the most scientifically rigorous way possible, as well as ensuring the safety and privacy of each [specimen].TC: How long can sperm be frozen?KK: Indefinitely.TC: How will you use all the data you;ll be collecting?KK: I could see us entering into partnerships with research institutions. What we won;t do is sell it like 23andMe.",https://tcrn.ch/2vA3nqQ

I’ve been on the Midas List for the past three years and was recently named on The New York Times’ list of The Top 20 Venture Capitalists. In 2008, I co-founded Floodgate, one of the first seed-stage VC funds in Silicon Valley. Unlike most funds, we invest exclusively in seed, making us experts in finding product-market fit and building a minimum viable company. Seed is fundamentally different from later stages, so we’ve made it more than a specialty: It’s all we do. Each of our partners sees thousands of companies every year before electing to invest in only the top three or four.For the past 11 years, I;ve invested at the inception phase of startups. We;ve seen startups go wildly right (Lyft, Refinery29, Twitch, Xamarin) and wildly wrong. When I reflect on the failures, the root cause inevitably stems from misconceptions around the nature of product-market fit.True product-market fit is a minimum viable companyBefore attempting to scale your minimum viable product, you should focus on cultivating your minimum viable company. Nail down your value proposition, find your place in the broader ecosystem and craft a business model that adds up. In other words, true product-market fit is actually the magical moment when three elements click together:Value propositionsEcosystemBusiness modelTo have built a minimum viable company, these three elements must work in concert together:People must value your product enough to be willing to pay for it. This value also determines how you package your product to the world (freemium versus free to pay versus enterprise sales).Your business model and pricing must fit your ecosystem. They must also generate enough sales volume and revenue to sustain your business.Your product’s value must satisfy the needs of the ecosystem and the ecosystem needs to accept your product.Many entrepreneurs conceptualize product-market fit as the point where some subset of customers love their product’s features. This conceptualization is dangerous. Many failing companies have features that customers loved. Some even have multiple beloved features! Great features constitute only one-half of one-third of the whole puzzle. To have created a minimum viable company, a company needs all three of these elements — value propositions, business model and ecosystem — working in concert. So founders take heed…Moving into “growth mode” while missing any of these elements is building your company on an unsound foundation.Founders who tune out the latest tweet cycle on “the secrets to raising Series A” and focus instead on the intricacies of their own business will find that product-market fit is a predictable, achievable phenomenon. On the other hand, founders who prematurely focus on growth without knowing the basic ingredients of their minimum viable company often fuel an addictive and destructive cycle around their business’ fake growth, acquiring non-optimal users that contribute to their company’s destruction.Read an extended version of this article on Extra Crunch.You need a minimum viable company, not a minimum viable product",https://tcrn.ch/2RMdLEP

The company opened at $18 before rising further, according to Yahoo Finance data. At its current price, One Medical is worth about 40% more than its IPO price, a strong debut for the company.The result is a boon for One Medical,  which raised $532.1 million during its time as a private company. At $14 per share, the company was worth $1.71 billion. At 19.50, One Medical is worth $2.38 billion, a winning result for a company said to be worth around $1.5 billion as a private company.For investors The Carlyle Group,  J.P. Morgan, Redmile Group, GV and Benchmark (among others), the debut is a success, pricing their stakes in the company higher once again. For other unicorns, the news is even better. One Medical, a company with gross margins under the 50% mark, deeply minority recurring revenue and 30% revenue growth in 2019 at best is now worth about 8.5x its trailing revenues.That is about as good a signal as one could imagine for venture-backed companies that aren;t in as good shape as Slack or Zoom were letting them know that now is the time to go public.Unicorn directionsIt;s possible to read One Medical;s new revenue multiple in a few ways. You can be positive, saying that its valuation and resulting metrics are signs of investor optimism for the medical service company. Or you could go negative and assume that its pricing looks like a case of the market being more excited about a brand than a set of accounting results.",https://tcrn.ch/31hH2dp

1940362,2020-01-31T06:47:06,"Moda Operandi, an online marketplace for high-end fashion, raises $100M led by NEA and Apax","Moda Operandi, an online marketplace that specialises in right-off-the-runway luxury fashion, accessories and home decor, is today announcing a high-priced event of its own: it;s raised $100 million, a mix of equity and debt that it will use to invest in its platform and technology as well as to continue growing business overall. Founded in 2010, it offers products from some 1,000 brands and designers and ships to 125 countries.“For the past eight years, Moda has disrupted the way people shop for luxury fashion,” said Moda Operandi  CEO Ganesh Srivats in a statement. “This investment will enable us to build on that innovation, investing further in the client and designer experience and connecting more of the world’s best fashion to more people.”The financing is being co-led by NEA and Apax Partners, both previous investors in Moda Operandi, with participation also from the Santo Domingo family (connected to Lauren Santo Domingo, who co-founded Moda with Aslaug Magnusdottir), Comerica Bank, TriplePoint Capital and other unnamed investors.The company;s valuation is not being disclosed, but in its last round, in 2017, Moda Operandi had a post-money valuation of $650 million, according to data from PitchBook. It has raised $345 million to date.High-end fashion might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think about online shopping, but it has actually been a ripe market for the e-commerce industry.While those in the know (and in the money) might attend catwalk shows, and bijou boutiques in swish locales are likely to be around for many years to come, there is a massive population of people who have the income and inclination to shop for luxury fashion, but might not be in the right place, or have the time, to do so.For these shoppers, websites, mobile apps and, most recently, new channels like Instagram and messaging services have become a key route to browsing and buying, leading to the rise of huge businesses like Farfetch, Net-a-Porter and more.That trend has helped to buffer Moda Operandi up to now, but it;s also the one that will be interesting to watch down the line.We;ve written about the rise of direct-to-consumer brands and how that has played out specifically in the world of fashion, which in turn becomes a new group of competitors to aggregating marketplaces like Moda Operandi.Similarly, the growing trend of targeting consumers wherever they happen to be also represents a rival business model, with some fashion retailers now foregoing websites altogether in favor of using third-party messaging apps to reach their target customers. Will Moda Operandi change with the times to do more of this kind of selling, too? Like fashion, what;s in today might be out tomorrow, so even the best channels are moving targets.In any case, Moda Operandi has most definitely shown that it;s prepared to evolve and upset the status quo. The company got its start in 2010 as part out of an aha-moment from Santo Domingo, a socialite, former model and former editor at Vogue.As someone who had worked for years in the luxury fashion industry, fully immersed as a consumer to boot, she knew that only a small, rarefied group of people ever got full access to a designer;s runway collection.Moda Operandi was her solution ; a platform to broaden that out, giving access to a full trunkshows (as the runway collections are called) to a wider selection of possible buyers and improving revenues for designers and brands in the process, as they no longer had to rely just on more traditional channels, namely buyers for retailers. The site had some catches ; for example, as we pointed out at the time, you could shop a runway look, but still had to wait months for the piece to actually arrive, as those items would have yet to be made; but it caught on with a loyal following.Over the years, the site;s basic remit has expanded, covering not only runway collections but also extending into jewelry, accessories and home decor. (We asked what size the business is today, and whether Moda Operandi can share any details on how that has changed over time, but a spokesperson said the company would not be sharing these or other financial details today.)In any case, it has remained a compelling enough business to have brought in a hefty round of growth funding from its previous backers.;We continue to be impressed with the power of Moda’s brand and its positioning in the luxury market,; said Dan O;Keefe, managing partner of Apax Digital, in a statement. “Moda has been enhancing its technology capabilities as a world leading platform for fashion discovery and is led by a world-class team. We look forward to continuing to support their expansion.”“Moda Operandi has really disrupted the traditional ecommerce model, using technology to give people unprecedented access to fashion,” added Tony Florence, general partner and head of technology investing at NEA, in a statement. “It was a really big idea when we led the Series A, and today Ganesh and the team are executing on that data-enabled retail model at scale. We are thrilled to continue supporting the company in this latest round.”",https://tcrn.ch/3b4AGmr
1940113,2020-01-31T06:00:30,How to blow through capital at an incredible rate,"Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.It was yet another jam-packed week full of big news, IPO happenings and venture activity. As always, we;ve done our best to deliver the gist on what;s been going on. We had Alex Wilhelm and Danny Crichton on hand to handle it all, which went medium-good. In other Equity news, we;re back with guests over the next few weeks, so if you miss us having a venture capitalist along for the ride, fear not, their return is just around the corner.Up top this week was Jon Shieber;s report that Kleiner Perkins has rapidly deployed its most recent fund, a $600 million vehicle. While the news felt surprising, digging back through our archives we were reminded that the firm had indicated it might put its capital to work quickly. Still, as Danny pointed out, it;s rare that venture capitalists have to go out raising from LPs on an annual basis.Kleiner Perkins has already blown through much of the $600 million it raised last yearAfter that, we turned to some funding rounds that held our attention, including the Free Agency round that is working to bring talent management to the technology industry similar to the sports and entertainment worlds.Free Agency wants to give every tech worker a career and salary boostThe concept makes some sense, as compensation packages for top talent in the industry can extend into the seven-figures (Free Agency takes a 5-10% cut of an employee;s income using the increasingly popular income-share agreements). Also, this round felt a bit like a reminder that the labor market is tight at the moment.How income share agreements will spark the rise of career acceleratorsWe then moved on to Josh Constine;s story about ;Ring for enterprise; startup Verkada, which raised a massive $80 million round at a $1.6 billion valuation. That;s eye-popping, since the extremely small dilution implied with those numbers (5%) is very rare in the venture world.Verkada raises $80M at $1.6B to be every building;s security OSAfter that we turned to a few rounds that Alex has had his eye on, namely the somewhat-recent Insurify round, the pretty-recent Gabi round and the most-recent Policygenius. All told, they sum to $150 million, which made us ask the question, why are venture capitalists so into insurance marketplace startups?Finally, we touched on the latest from the intra-SoftBank delivery war between DoorDash and Uber Eats, including who is impacted, and what it means for future consolidation in the on-demand world. Or more precisely, why hasn;t there been more?Finally, don;t forget that IPO season is upon us.

And he sees commenting as a natural next step toward his goal to become ;the main monetization and community engagement solution for publishers.;While ;don;t read the comments; remains one of the most reliable pieces of advice you;ll get online, Dugow said Squawk-It (it was formerly known as Solid Opinion) stands out from other commenting platforms because of its reliance on ;100 percent human moderation,; with moderators working in three shifts to monitor partner sites 24 hours each day.;Anybody can game an algorithm,; he said.And when I brought up the concern that so much of the discussion has moved out of the comments section and onto social media, Dugow responded that ;merging social commenting; so that it feels like everything is part of the same conversation is ;in our roadmap.;Like other Insticator products, Squawk-It comments (which you can see below the article here) are monetized through advertising. But Dugow noted that the ads run above the comments, rather than interrupting or distracting from the comments themselves.The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. Dugow said the entire 13-person Squawk-It team (headquartered in New York but with an engineering team in Kiev) has joined Insticator, and that the product has already been rebranded as Insticator Comments.Insticator raises $5.2M to help publishers make their stories more interactive",https://tcrn.ch/36Glath
1939870,2020-01-30T14:42:50,Mammoth Biosciences aims to be Illumina for the gene editing generation,"In 1998, the startup company Illumina launched a revolution in the life sciences industry by developing technology to slash the costs of identifying and mapping genetic material.Now, a little over 20 years later, Mammoth Biosciences is hoping to do the same thing for gene editing tools.The company, co-founded by Jennifer Doudna, who did some of the pioneering work to discover the gene editing enzyme known as CRISPR, has just raised $45 million as it looks to bring to market products that can be used not only for disease detection, but are more precise editing tools for genetic material.Rather than get bogged down in the patent dispute that raged over the provenance and ownership of applications for the original CRISPR enzyme ; the Cas9 discovered by Doudna and developed for clinical applications at the Broad Institute ; Mammoth has joined a number of startups in identifying new enzymes with a broader array of properties.;From the very beginning of the company we’ve only worked with novel new enzymes to create these diagnostic products and the new novel diagnostic and editing,; says Trevor Martin, Mammoth Biosciences co-founder and chief executive.Chiefly, the company is touting its Cas14 enzyme, which the company says opens up new possibilities for programmable biology thanks to its small size, diverse targeting ability and high fidelity ; meaning that there are no unforeseen side effects to edits made using the enzyme (something that has arisen with Cas9 applications).;There’s not one protein that’s going to be the best at everything,; says Martin. ;For any particular product that you’re building, at Mammoth, we have the broadest toolbox.;The Cas14 enzyme can be used to make gene edits in-vivo, meaning in live organisms, instead of ex-vivo, or outside of an organism. The in-vivo use-case could accelerate the time it takes to conduct experiments or develop treatments.“Twenty years from now, when the umpteenth drug gets approved using Crispr and some nuclease named Cas132013, people are going to look back on this patent battle and think, ‘what a godawful waste of money,’ ; Jacob Sherkow a patent law scholar at New York Law School told Wired back in 2018.Already, Horizon Discovery, a Cambridge, U.K.-based gene editing technology developer, is using the new tools developed by Mammoth Bioscience to create new CRISPR tools for Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line editing.That partnership is an example of how Mammoth is thinking about the commercialization of the new Cas14 enzyme line and its role in biological engineering.;You will need a full toolbox of CRISPR proteins,; says Martin. ;That will allow you to interact with biology in the same way that we interact with software and computers. ;From first principles, companies will programmatically modify biology to cure a disease or decrease risk for a disease. That;s going to be really kind of a turning point.;To achieve its vision, Mammoth has managed to nab top talent from the life sciences industry, including Peter Nell, a co-founder of Casebia (a joint venture between Bayer  and CRISPR Therapeutics),  who came on board as chief business officer, and Ted Tisch, a former executive at Synthego and Bio-Rad, who joined the company as chief operating officer.The company also nabbed $45 million of funding, including investment firms Mayfield, NFX, Verily (the Alphabet subsidiary) and Brook Byers, which was led by Decheng Capital ; bringing the company to more than $70 million in funding.;There are a dozen or so products that are in clinical development with CRISPR,; says Ursheet Parikh, a partner with Mayfield. ;Maybe that number would go up by five or 10 without Mammoth, but it will go up by one or two orders of magnitude with Mammoth.;To Parikh, Mammoth is the best positioned of the CRISPR development tools, because the company is building a whole platform that customers can license and use to develop products using gene editing.The thinking, according to Parikh, is as follows, ;if this technology can power lots of applications, let’s basically ensure that lots of these applications can come to market and as that happens I get my app store cut.;;It’s an Illumina-like business,; Parikh says. ;Just as anybody who is innovating with genomics needs an Illumina sequencer because they want to be able to do the sequencing; if someone wants to do editing; This gives them the access to do the right sequencing.;",https://tcrn.ch/319hIpX

A surprise, perhaps, in the wake of the WeWork meltdown that many had expected might reduce IPO cadence. One Medical  and Casper,  though, are charging ahead, meaning that their debuts will help set the tone for the 2020 IPO market.If they struggle with weak pricing and slow initial trading, their disappointing offerings could slow the IPO market. If they price well and are welcomed by the street, however, the opposite.Let;s take a look at how many IPOs are coming, what One Medical and Casper are hoping for and what their results might mean for unicorn liquidity. Don;t forget that we;re still living in the midst of a unicorn liquidity crisis — there are hundreds of private companies worth $1 billion or more around the world that need an exist, and the market is creating them faster than it can get them out the door. If IPOs stumble in 2020, lots just won;t make it out before the market turns.An IPO crowdYesterday, CNBC reported notes from Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman and NYSE President Stacey Cunningham, each speaking about their expected IPO cadence in 2020.

While The Bouqs still must compete with bigger contenders like 1-800-Flowers and FTD in the U.S., it will now have to take on incumbents like Ayoma Flower Market and FloraJapan, both of which also offer same-day delivery throughout the land of the rising sun.So why Japan? According to The Bouqs founder and CEO John Tabis, his company had been looking to expand internationally for awhile and Japan seemed to fit well within that plan.The Bouqs CEO and founder John TabisBut as far as bigger competition in any country, Tabis is undeterred, telling TechCrunch there;s plenty of opportunities in the flower delivery business if you know where to look. ;There;ve been four or five other startups that tried something similar ; some of them no longer exist,; Tabis said. ;But the thing that;s worked for us, the first is the way that we;ve sourced is unique and it;s really the foundation of our brand.;The Bouqs sprung up in a wave of Silicon Valley funded flower delivery startups like BloomThat,  Farm Girl and  Urban Stems, all promising Pinterest -worthy bouquets at the click of a button. But what set it apart was its farm-direct supply chain, cutting out costs from middlemen and delivering flowers that last longer.This particular round now puts The Bouqs up top as far as total funding raised among its flower delivery startup peers, bringing in $74 million in total funding to date, with competitor Urban Stems in second place with $27 million in funding, according to Crunchbase.Tabis also tells TechCrunch the new funds will further the company;s development into brick-and-mortar stores and that it;s jumping into the wedding biz. As anyone who;s ever planned a wedding will tell you, it;s an industry ripe for disruption ; with brides and grooms spending about 8% of the budget on the flowers alone.One other renewed focus for the company will be its subscription business, keeping customers set up with a fresh bunch of flowers once the old bouquet is ready for tossing. ;It;s sort of the linchpin of our business that;s grown very nicely;expanding both our revenue and profitability,; Tabis told TechCrunch.The SVP of Yamasa, Norikazu Sano, also mentioned further expansion into Asia for the company in a company press release, so we could see The Bouqs in more international areas over time, if all goes right in Japan.“This financing will enable us to fully realize our vision to create a global network of top-quality farms paired with a category-defining local floral brand enabled by proprietary supply chain technology and vertically integrated sourcing capabilities. We’re so excited for this next phase of the business, and all of the opportunities that lie ahead,” Tabis said.",https://tcrn.ch/3aXWIqz

1939812,2020-01-30T08:46:23,SoftBank wants its on-demand portfolio to stop losing so much money,"SoftBank  wants its competing portfolio companies to stop losing so much money and, in some cases, to merge.That;s the news out from Financial Times today, which reported that Uber and DoorDash discussed merging last year. The talks didn;t wind up in a deal.The two companies, each heavily backed by SoftBank and its formerly active Vision Fund, compete in the food delivery space at great expense. Uber;s  Eats business turned $392 million in adjusted net revenue in Q3 2019 into $316 million adjusted loss. That ocean of red ink actually makes DoorDash;s reported, projected $450 million 2019 operating loss look modest.Perhaps by bringing the two companies together they would lose less money, and thus be in a better place to either return to their original IPO valuation or defend their existing private valuation.Uber has famously struggled to retain value after its IPO, shedding worth during its public offering and since its debut. DoorDash,  relatedly, was said to be in the market recently, but unable to close a new, large funding round. And as the two companies compete, a combination makes sense. Even more so when you consider their shared shareholder.Other chaosUber and DoorDash aren;t the only examples of SoftBank-backed companies beating each other up with bricks of Vision Fund cash.According to a report today in The Wall Street Journal, a fight in Latin America between several SoftBank-backed companies is raging:Uber is under siege in Latin America amid a bruising price war where its ostensible rivals are Rappi and China’s Didi Chuxing Technology Co. But here’s the twist. All the combatants have as their biggest owner the same tech investor, Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp., which has injected a total of $20 billion into the three.In the pre-unicorn era, you;ll recall the old venture maxim that no single group should invest in competing players. After all, why pay for one portfolio company to beat on another startup that you already helped finance? SoftBank, with its own investments and the Vision Fund, ignored that rule, and now it;s financing a fustercluck across the various American continents. (Though, there are some examples of other firms doing this, like Sequoia putting money into Uber and Didi.)As Bird buys Circ, a rewind of scooter VC, M&#038;A and financial reportingWhich is why it might want DoorDash and Uber to link up. It might lessen one headache. Then SoftBank could work on figuring out how to keep Uber and Didi from beating each other up on rides in other markets, while disentangling Uber Eats  and Rappi from a delivery scrap in yet more.Perhaps SoftBank wants all the players to merge into a single, mega-delivery and ride corp. That would never pass regulatory oversight, of course, but at least it would centralize the losses and cash burn into a single income statement.Think of the time it would save!",https://tcrn.ch/314ZKoE
1939648,2020-01-30T08:28:06,SpaceX cautions on launch regulation that outpaces innovation,"During the Federal Aviation Administration;s  (FAA) 23rd annual Commercial Space Transportation Conference in Washington, D.C., one panel focused on the changing regulatory environment when it comes to private launch activities, and how those are integrated into existing rules and practices for managing commercial air transportation. Panelist Caryn Schenewerk, SpaceX  senior counsel and senior director of space flight policy, emphasized that while the company always does the utmost to ensure safety in everything it does, the company also wants to focus on the actual state of the industry today and how it needs to grow as various partners work to establish new rules for the growing commercial launch sector.;When aviation started, the Wright brothers weren;t flying over major populated cities,; Schenewerk pointed out. ;They were outside Paris in an unpopulated field, and they were at Kitty Hawk on unpopulated beaches. And they were in Ohio in unpopulated areas.;Schenewerk was directly addressing comments made by other panelists, and specifically ALPA Aviation Safety Chair Steve Jangelis, that suggested the emerging commercial launch industries may be looking far ahead to when they;re launching from spaceports located near populated areas, and launching with much more frequency than they are today. In general, Jangelis was advocating for laying the groundwork now for high levels of cooperation and integration between aviation traffic management and rocket launch operators.Schenewerk was reluctant to concede any kind of direct equivalency between the commercial air transportation industry and the space launch sector, given their relative dissimilarity.She noted that in terms of sheer volume, there;s a massive difference, with roughly 40 to 50 launches set for 2020 compared to millions of flights for commercial air. Airlines also use essentially the same small handful of airframes from suppliers like Boeing and Airbus,  while each launch company has their own, very different vehicle with different conditions for launch and flight. Overall, she suggested then that anticipating some potential future state where the industries were more similar could result in stifling progress toward that ultimate goal.;I hope we get to that million launches at some point, but when we are at that point, it;s going to be because we worked our way up the safety trajectory in a way that allows us to operate that way,; Schenewerk said. ;Today, SpaceX can;t fly from a spaceport in the middle of the country, because we won;t get through the safety approval. We literally will not be licensed by the FAA to operate from that site, because we will then be flying over large populations of people ; and we aren;t at that level of reliability and safety in this industry to fly over large populations of people with these kinds of rockets. Could we get there someday? Yeah, we can get there someday when we;ve had a million flights, and a million prove-outs of our capability, when we have such repeatability that we;re in that level.;Ultimately, Schenewerk;s comments and Jangelis; responses illustrate that there are still a lot of places where younger companies and emerging technologies like reusable rocket launches are conflicting with the views of more established industries and players operating in some shared spaces.FAA Administrator Steve Dickson also addressed the agency;s ongoing work to establish launch rules, which were released as a draft last year and which Dickson said will likely be finalized sometime this fall, once the FAA has incorporated industry comments and feedback.;Let;s think about that big vision, that big day when lots of things are happening,; Schenewerk said. ;But let;s also not yell at our kid for not being able to fly an airplane when they can barely walk ; and I think that;s where we are right now: We;re still figuring out how to walk and run in this industry.;",https://tcrn.ch/2RZMihC

This time, he;s focused solely on truck drivers and their businesses. CloudTrucks, which aims to help truck drivers earn more money, has closed a $6.1 million round led by Craft Ventures with participation from Khosla Ventures, Kindred Ventures and Abstract Ventures.Described as a ;business in a box,; CloudTrucks is designed to make it easier for truck owners and operators to run their businesses. Through software and data science, CloudTrucks aims to reduce operating costs for truck drivers and improve revenue, cash-flow and costs.In the U.S., about 91% of fleets are small businesses, operating six or fewer trucks, according to the American Trucking Associations. Last year, almost 800 trucking businesses went bankrupt in the U.S. Analysts attribute that to a rise in insurance costs and excess supply, which drove shipping rates down. Additionally, operators are tasked with managing safety programs, invoicing and other paperwork. This is where CloudTrucks comes in.;CloudTrucks focuses on the owner-operator and small trucking companies because they are the lifeblood of the industry and facing the largest pressures with fast-rising insurance rates, predatory factoring options and a quickly changing landscape,; Arodiogbu told TechCrunch.Already, CloudTrucks has a small number of early customers to fine-tune the platform. The startup is accepting new customers on a case-by-case basis.Prior to CloudTrucks, Arodiogbu co-founded Scotty Labs to enable humans to virtually control cars and trucks. The idea was to assist drivers in long-haul trips. Before DoorDash;s acquisition of the startup, Scotty Labs had raised $6 million in funding. Now, Arodiogbu serves as an advisor to DoorDash.;Tobenna is a proven entrepreneur and product thinker with a clear vision of the problem CloudTrucks intends to solve,; Craft co-founder and general partner David Sacks said in a statement to TechCrunch. “Trucking is at the heart of the American economy and yet technology still plays a very small role. We are excited to support the entire CloudTrucks team as they build the platform that will increase revenue and efficiency for thousands of owner-operator truck drivers.”",https://tcrn.ch/2S5mfp8

He focuses primarily on investments in software and technology-enabled business services.			I work every day with company founders who are grappling with the challenges of driving business growth while keeping their finances on an even keel. One topic we often discuss is how to take advantage of debt to drive business growth — without it turning into a problem.In my experience, debt can serve as a valuable piece of a company’s capital structure. The key is to use debt for the right purposes and to understand the implications of doing so. For example, short-term loans (one to two-year terms) are useful for financing receivables and inventory to help manage cash flow. These working capital facilities have attractive interest rates (often in the 5% range) and are well understood by the lending community.By contrast, mezzanine loans (usually three to five-year terms) are better suited to provide the flexibility and runway needed to prove out certain initiatives prior to securing an equity investment or a liquidity event. These loans tend to have limited covenants, are not secured by specific working capital assets and are junior to the working capital loans. Given their higher-risk profile, they are more expensive than short-term loans, with lenders typically targeting a return of 15% to 20%, split between a current pay interest rate of 10%+ and expected stock appreciation from the receipt of warrant coverage.Regardless of the type of debt a company takes on, there are certain principles to consider to keep the debt from threatening the success of the business. Should you decide to take on debt, understand the implications and consider the following five rules:",https://tcrn.ch/31bNjrg

1939538,2020-01-30T07:00:56,Haus raises $4.5 million to replace your wine club membership,"Millennials are tired of being drunk, but are locked into a culture that puts alcohol at the center of professional events and outside-of-work gatherings. Twenty-somethings in New York and San Francisco don’t want to spend $17 on a gin and tonic at a compulsory happy hour. That’s why Haus, a new direct-to-consumer aperitif startup, is debuting its membership program.Co-founders Helena Price Hambrecht and Woody Hambrecht, who are married, have also secured $4.5 million in seed funding to fuel their bid for a more laid back and less alcohol-centric way to party, starting with a 15% ABV (alcohol by volume) citrus and flower-flavored aperitif. For comparison, most hard liquors are between 35 and 45% alcohol. Wine averages at 11.6%. Members across the U.S. can now sign up for a monthly shipment of either six bottles per month for $144, two bottles per month for $63 or one bottle per month for $35. Unlike most wine clubs, it;s free to join. Haus will also begin a wholesale initiative with bars and restaurants in New York, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle and Denver.The genesis for Haus was the founders’ idea to create a transparent alcohol brand, or a “Glossier for alcohol,” notes Helena, a Silicon Valley branding veteran. Woody, an experienced winemaker, identified a loophole that allows distributors to ship alcohol direct-to-consumer if the product is made mostly from grapes and is under 24% alcohol. Not only could a beverage be distributed straight to buyers, but it can be done with transparency, including ingredients and nutrition facts. This will allow Haus to collect user data that big alcohol companies just don’t have.“Antiquated liquor laws have stunted innovation in the spirits space since prohibition, despite the fact that today’s drinkers are desperate for something different,” says Price Hambrecht. “Selling directly to the drinker means we can build relationships with our customers, iterate quickly based on their feedback and ultimately create the products they want.” So, Haus was born. Co-founders and co-CEOs Helena Price Hambrecht and Woody Hambrecht.Haus saw fundraising as a chance to grow not only an early community of stakeholders, but customers. Helena equates their fundraising process to more of a crowdfunding approach than a traditional VC round, with over 10 funds and 100 individual investors contributing. Raising capital meant crowdsourcing a community of people who believed in what they were building and were willing to seed it into their own networks. Some angels included Casey Neistat, former CEO and chairman of Campari Gerry Ruvo, Away co-founder Jen Rubio, Superhuman founder Rahul Vohra and Yelp co-founder Russell Simmons.Contributing funds include Combine, Haystack Ventures, Homebrew, Shrug Capital, Resolute Venture Partners, Coatue, Dream Machine and Work Life Ventures, among others. Subscriptions work when customers form habits. Haus plans to retain its community around its trendy party beverage with discounts and events, bolstered by editorial content in the future. What the founders are really pitching, however, is a lifestyle change.In “The Art of the Gathering,” Priya Parker argues that in our modern society, we;ve lost our ability to finesse purposeful events. We end up gathering in ways that don’t actually serve us, and we aren’t connecting in the ways we ought to. Whether it;s a boring dinner party that isn’t focused on the guests, or a dreaded happy hour after a long work day. It has yet to be determined if aperitifs could win over wine and liquor lovers at a macro scale. But Haus thinks that with a trendy product and hyper-engaged community, they can leverage this loophole to change the way we gather. Starting with how we drink. ",https://tcrn.ch/2REh0Oe

In total, OpsRamp says it now has 1,400 customers on its platform and alliances with AWS, ServiceNow, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure.OpsRamp co-founder and CEO Varma KunaparajuAccording to OpsRamp co-founder and CEO Varma Kunaparaju, most of the company;s customers are mid to large enterprises. ;These IT teams have large, complex, hybrid IT environments and need help to simplify and consolidate an incredibly fragmented, distributed and overwhelming technology and infrastructure stack,; he said. ;The company is also seeing success in the ability of our partners to help us reach global enterprises and Fortune 5000 customers.;Kunaparaju told me that the company plans to use the new funding to expand its go-to-market efforts and product offerings. ;The company will be using the money in a few different areas, including expanding our go-to-market motion and new pursuits in EMEA and APAC, in addition to expanding our North American presence,; he said. ;We;ll also be doubling-down on product development on a variety of fronts.;Given that hybrid clouds only increase the workload for IT organizations and introduce additional tools, it;s maybe no surprise that investors are now interested in companies that offer services that rein in this complexity. If anything, we;ll likely see more deals like this one in the coming months.;As more of our customers transition to hybrid infrastructure, we find the OpsRamp platform to be a differentiated IT operations management offering that aligns well with the core strategies of HPE,; said Paul Glaser, vice president and head of Hewlett Packard Pathfinder. ;With OpsRamp’s product vision and customer traction, we felt it was the right time to invest in the growth and scale of their business.;",https://tcrn.ch/3b4EdB8
1939599,2020-01-30T05:00:41,Codility raises $22M for its tech recruiting platform,"Codility, a platform that helps tech recruiters and hiring managers asses candidates through online coding tests, today announced that it has raised a $22 million Series A round led by Oxx and Kennet Partners.This marks the first time Codility  has raised any funding, after 10 years as a bootstrapped company. Clearly, though, despite having achieved double-digit annual recurring revenue in those 10 years, the team now believes that it has an opportunity to grow its market share in what is becoming a more competitive market for tech hiring platforms ; and to do so, it needs outside funding.So far, the company has brought on an impressive list of customers, including Microsoft,  Tesla,  Slack, Okta, Rakuten, American Express and UnitedHealth Group. In total, the company says it had 1,500 customers in 2019 and helped them evaluate more than 450,000 candidates, a number the company says has grown over 50% year-over-year.What sets Codility apart from similar platforms is that it aims to provide coding tests that are closer to what engineers typically face in their day-to-day jobs instead of highly abstract whiteboarding sessions that evaluate their theory of algorithms knowledge.;The biggest bottleneck to achieving this lies in sourcing, screening and interviewing,; said Codility CEO Natalia Panowicz. ;This is where Codility comes in. We allow businesses to deliver great experiences to candidates and deep insights to the hiring team ; improving decision-making and ultimately increasing their overall engineering capacity.;The company says its system allows it to provide recruiters with a ;360-degree evaluation of technical ability; that helps managers ensure that a candidate is a good fit for a given position. Ideally, this also reduces the effect of unconscious bias in the recruiting and placement process.As part of its platform, Codility offers its technical skills and evaluation services for recruiters, including a shared editor for live technical interviews. In addition, the company also helps companies run their own coding competitions, which they can then use to identify potential candidates, including those who aren;t actively looking for a new job.;Codility is a great solution for hiring teams based on the needs of quality high-volume hiring; such as consistency, standardization and scalability,; said Vicky Xiong, senior director of Engineering at Okta . ;Codility also enables Okta to create a great candidate experience, which is core to our values as a company.;",https://tcrn.ch/2Gznsjn
1939109,2020-01-30T04:48:11,"Where top VCs are investing in travel, tourism and hospitality tech","The venture community has been fixated on travel and hospitality since the dot-com era and early-2000s, when mainstays like Kayak and Airbnb were still Silicon Valley darlings. As the multi-trillion-dollar global travel and hospitality market continues to grow, VCs are still foaming at the mouth for the opportunity to redefine the ways we move and stay around the world.Despite the cyclical nature of the travel sector, deal flow in travel and hospitality has remained strong and largely stable over the last half-decade, according to data from Crunchbase and PitchBook. Over the same period, we’ve seen more than a handful of startups in the space reach unicorn status, including companies like Klook, Sonder, Flixbus, Vacasa, Wheels Up, TripActions and others.High-profile funding rounds also appear to be popping up across travel and hospitality’s various sub-sectors, including bookings, activity marketplaces, short-term rental, tourism and hotel platforms. And companies are continuing to pull in funding rounds in the hundreds of millions to billion-dollar range, such as India hotel network company Oyo, which raised $1.5 billion in funding as recently as December.While VC investment in the space has remained resilient, some investors are predicting it’s only a matter of time before the travel startup world hits a downturn. To get a temperature check on the state of the travel market, the outlook for fundraising and which sub-sectors might present the most attractive opportunities for startups today, we asked five leading VCs at firms spanning early to growth stages to share what’s exciting them most and where they see opportunity in travel, tourism and hospitality tech:Bonny Simi, JetBlue Technology VenturesPete Flint, NFXTige Savage, Revolution VenturesBrad Greiwe, Fifth WallPrashant Fonseka, Tuesday Capital",https://tcrn.ch/36F8RgW
1935102,2020-01-30T01:10:30,Maze raises $2 million and adds Figma support to enable user testing at scale,"Maze wants to reinvent usability tests by letting you turn design prototypes into tests in just a few clicks. It could become the equivalent of a developing test suite for developers, but this time for designers — it could be something that you run before shipping an update to make sure everything works fine. The startup just raised a $2 million funding round and launched a couple of new features.Since I first covered the company, Maze founders Jonathan Widawski and Thomas Mary still have the same vision. The company wants to empower designers and turn them into user-testing experts. With Maze, you can turn your InVision, Marvel or Sketch projects into a browser-based user test.You can then share a link with a group of users to get actionable insights on your upcoming design changes. Everything works in a web browser on both desktop and mobile.After running a testing campaign, you get a detailed report with a success rate (how many people tapped on all the right buttons to achieve something in your app), where your users drop off, polling results and more.That product has been working well, attracting 20,000 users working for IBM, Greenpeace, Accenture, BMW and more.Now, Maze also supports Figma projects. Given the hype behind Figma, adding this feature is important to stay relevant. It also opens up a new market for Maze — companies using Figma as their main design tool.Maze has also added a feature that should be particularly useful for companies that are just starting with user testing. The startup can put together a testers panel for you.This is completely optional and you can just stick with your monthly software-as-a-service plan and work with your own panel. But it provides a good end-to-end experience if you want to centralize all your user testing needs under one roof.Maze has also raised a $2 million funding round. Amplify Partners  is leading the round, with existing investors Seedcamp and ParTech also participating. Business angels in this round include Eric Wittman, the former director of Operations at Adobe and COO at Figma; Peter Skomoroch, the former head of AI Automation &amp; Data Products at Workday; and Datadog CEO Olivier Pomel.",https://tcrn.ch/2G8iV7f
1939494,2020-01-29T17:28:52,All eyes are on the next liquidity event when it comes to space startups,"At the FAA;s 23rd Annual Commercial Space Transportation Conference in Washington, DC on Wednesday, a panel dedicated to the topic of trends in VC around space startups touched on public versus private funding, the right kinds of space companies that should even be considering venture funding and, perhaps most notably, the big L: Liquidity.Moderator Tess Hatch,  vice president at Bessemer Venture Partners, addressed the topic in response to an audience question that noted while we;ve heard a lot about how much money will flow into space-related startups from the VC community, we haven;t actually seen much in the way of liquidity events that prove out the validity of these investments.;In 2008, a company called Skybox was created and a handful of years later Google  acquired the company for $500 million,; Hatch said. ;Every venture capitalist;s ears perked up and they thought ;Hey, that;s pretty good ROI in a short amount of time ; maybe the space thing is an investable area,; and then a ton of venture capital investments flooded into space startups, and all of these venture capitalists made one, or maybe two investments in the area. Since then, there have not been many — if any — liquidity events: Perhaps Virgin Galactic going public via the SPAC (special purpose vehicle) on the New York Stock Exchange late last year would be the second. So we;re still waiting; we;re still waiting for those exits, we are still waiting for companies to pave the path for the 400+ startups in the ecosystem to return our investment.;Hatch added that she;s looking at a number of companies who have the potential to break this somewhat prolonged exit drought in 2020, including five that are either quite mature in terms of their development, naming SpaceX,  Rocket Lab,  Planet and Spire as all likely candidates to have some kind of liquidity event in 2020, with the mostly likely being an IPO.Space as an industry was described to me recently as a ;maturing; startup market by Space Angels CEO Chad Anderson, by virtue of the distribution of activity in terms of the overall investment rounds in the sector. There is indeed a lot of activity with early-stage companies and seed rounds, but the fact remains that there hasn;t been much in the way of exits, and it;s also worth pointing out that corporate VCs haven;t been as acquisitive in space as some of their consumer and enterprise technology counterparts.The panel touched on a lot more apart from liquidity, which actually only came up toward the end of the discussion. Panelists included Astranis CEO and co-founder John Gedmark; Capella Space CEO and founder Payam Banazadeh and Rocket Lab VP of Global Commercial Launch Services Shane Fleming. Both Gedmark and Banazadeh addressed aspects of the risks and benefits of seeking VC as a space technology company.;Not every space business is a venture-backable business,; said Banazadeh earlier in the conversation. ;But there are a lot of space businesses that are specifically going after raising venture money, and that;s dangerous for everyone ; because at the end of the day, venture is looking at high risk, high return. The ;high return; comes from being able to get substantial amounts of revenue in a market that;s bigenough for those revenues to be coming from. But if your idea is to go build, maybe, some very specific part in a satellite, then you have to make the case of why you;ll be able to make those returns for the investors, and in a lot of cases, that;s just not possible.;Banazadeh also concedes that doing any kind of space technology development is expensive, and the money has to come from somewhere. Gedmark talked about one popular source, government funding and grants, and why that often isn;t as obviously a positive thing for startups as it might seem.;Small government grants can be great, and obviously a fantastic source of non-dilutive capital,; Gedmark said. ;But there is a little bit of a trick there, or something to be aware of: I think people are often surprised how much time is spent in the early days of a startup refining the exact idea and the product, and if you;re not certain that you have that product market fit [;] then, the government grant can be extremely dangerous, because they will fund you to do something that is sort of similar to what to what you;re doing, but it really prevents you changing your approach later; you;re going to end up spending time executing on the specific project of the program manager on the government side and you;re executing on what they want.;VC funds, on the other hand, come with the built-in expectation that you;re going to refine and potentially even change direction altogether, Gedmark says. Depending on the terms of the public funding you;re seeking, that flexibility may not be part of the arrangement, which ultimately could be more important than a bit of equity dilution.",https://tcrn.ch/2vy3YcJ
1938604,2020-01-29T13:05:49,UCSD hospital gets a drone delivery program powered by Matternet and UPS,"Drone delivery may not make a lot of sense for food or parcel delivery yet, but for hospitals it could be a lifesaver. A new test program is being inaugurated at UC San Diego;s Jacobs Medical Center, where Matternet  drones operated by UPS will fly blood samples and other items to and from other nearby facilities.The new program will be the third under Matternet;s belt; an earlier partnership with UPS has made some 1,900 flights at WakeMed hospital in North Carolina, and flights with SwissPost in Zurich resume this month after crashes put them on ice over the summer.UPS partners with drone startup Matternet for medical sample deliveriesBiological samples and other items that need to be moved quickly generally travel by courier service, which is of course fine sometimes, but not during rush hour. No one wants to have a second spinal tap because the first one got stuck in traffic.The flights these drones will be undertaking will be autonomous, but with remote monitoring and line of sight from Jacobs to the Moores Cancer Center and Center for Advanced Laboratory Medicine, both of which are less than a mile away.It;s a big month for Matternet, which in addition to these two concurrent flight test programs recently pulled in a strategic round from the healthcare-focused McKesson Ventures.",https://tcrn.ch/36ylQRn
1939253,2020-01-29T11:47:39,Verkada raises $80M at $1.6B to be every building;s security OS,"Fifty iPads were stolen from Verkada  co-founder Hans Robertson;s old company. Only when they checked the security system did they realize the video cameras hadn;t been working for months. He was pissed. ;The market lagged behind the progress seen in the consumer space, where someone could buy high-end cameras with cloud-based software to protect their home,; Verkada;s CEO and co-founder Filip Kaliszan tells me of his own attempt to buy enterprise-grade security hardware.Usually, startups ascend on the backs of fresh technologies and developer platforms. But Kaliszan and Robertson realized that commercial security was so backward that just implementing the established principles of machine vision and the cloud could create a huge company. The plan was to keep data secure yet accessible and train its cameras to take clearer photos when AI detects suspicious situations instead of just grainy video.At first, few could see the vision through the slow upgrade cycles and basement security rooms common with most potential clients. ;The seed and the A were extremely difficult rounds to raise compared to the later rounds because people didn;t believe we could execute what we are proposing,; Kaliszan glumly recalls.But today Verkada receives a huge vote of confidence. It just raised an $80 million Series C at a stunning $1.6 billion post-money valuation thanks to lead investor Felicis Ventures writing Verkada its biggest check to date. The cash brings Verkada to $139 million in funding to sell dome cameras, fisheye lenses, footage viewing stations and the software to monitor it all from anywhere.Why sink in so much cash at a valuation triple that of Verkada;s $540 million price tag after its April 2019 Series B? Because Verkada wants to bring two-factor authentication to doors with its new access control system that it;s announcing is now in beta testing ahead of a Spring launch. Instead of just allowing a stealable key fob or badge to open your office entryway, it could ask you to look into a Verkada camera too so it can match your face to your permissions.;Our mission is to be the essential physical security software layer for every building, and the foundation of a larger enterprise IoT infrastructure,; Kaliszan tells me. By uniting security cameras and door locks in one system, it could keep banks, schools, hospitals, government buildings and businesses safe while offering new insights on how their spaces are used.The founders; pedigrees don;t hurt its efforts to sell that future to investors like Next47,  Sequoia Capital and Meritech Capital, which joined the round. Robertson co-founded IT startup Meraki and sold it to Cisco for $1.2 billion. Kaliszan and his other co-founders Benjamin Bercovitz and James Ren started CourseRank for education software while at Stanford before selling it to Chegg.Making a better product than what;s out there isn;t rocket science, though. Many building security systems only let footage be accessed from a control room in the building; which doesn;t help much if everyone;s trying to escape due to emergency or if a manager elsewhere simply wants to take a look. Verkada;s cloud lets the right employees keep watch from mobile, and data is also stored locally on the cameras so they keep recording even if the internet cuts out. ;Our competitors stream unencrypted video and it;s on you to protect it. We;re responsible for handling that data,; Kaliszan says.Verkada;s machine vision software can make sense of all the footage its cameras collect. ;We can immediately show them all the video containing a particular person of interest rather than manually searching through hours of footage,; Kaliszan insists. ;Our platform can use AI/machine learning to recognize patterns and behaviors that are out of the norm in real time.;For example, a hostage negotiator was able to use Verkada;s system to assess whether a SWAT team needed to invade a building. Verkada can group all spottings of an individual together for review, or scan all the footage for people wearing a certain color or with other search filters.Indeed, 2,500 clients, including 25 Fortune 500 companies, are already using Verkada. In the last year it has tripled revenue, partnered with 1,100 resellers, launched nine new camera models, added people and vehicle analytics, opened its first London office and is on track to grow from 300 to 800 employees by the end of 2020.;We call this reinvention,; says Felicis Ventures  founder and managing director Aydin Senkut. ;One thing people underestimate is how big this market is. Honeywell is valued at $110 billion-plus. There;s a Chinese company that;s over $50 billion. The opportunity to be the operating system for all buildings in the world? Sounds like that market couldn;t be better.; Senkut knows Verkada works because he had it installed in all his homes and offices.Most enterprise software companies don;t have to worry about the complexities of hardware supply chains. There;s always a risk that its sales process stumbles, leaving it stuck with too many cameras. ;We;re still burning money. We;re not there yet or we wouldn;t be raising venture. Because we;re going after a mature market, you can;t come at it with a model that doesn;t make sense. Investors come at it from a hard-nosed approach,; Robertson admits.;People have a tendency to write off Verkada as a boring camera company. They don;t realize how access control as the second product is going to supercharge the company;s potential,; Senkut declares.One bullet Verkada dodged is the one firmly lodged in Amazon;s chest. Ring security cameras have received stern criticism over Amazon;s cooperation with law enforcement that some see as a violation of privacy and expansion of a police state. ;We don’t have any arrangements with law enforcement like Ring,; Kaliszan tells me. ;We view ourselves as providing great physical security tools to the people that run schools, hospitals and businesses. The data that those organizations gather is their own.;",https://tcrn.ch/3aOLvZH
1939217,2020-01-29T10:00:19,Coinbase poaches Google Shopping VP as CPO for cryptocommerce,";We;re trying to shift cryptocurrency from this speculative asset class to driving real-world utility,; Coinbase  CEO Brian Armstrong tells me. How? Through commerce and micropayments. But now Coinbase has the who to build it. Today the startup announced it has hired away former head of Product for Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart and Google Shopping VP of Product Surojit Chatterjee to become Coinbase;s chief product officer.;I’ve always enjoyed being associated with technology that is on the brink of changing how we live; writes Chatterjee. ;Google ads has helped democratize commerce, Flipkart and ecommerce has revolutionized life in India, and I believe Coinbase is going to turn conventional finance on its head.;Chatterjee spent more than 11 years at Google  over two stints, the first as a founding member of Google;s mobile search Ads product that;s grown to tens of billions in revenue per year. When he starts at Coinbase next week, Armstrong tells me he;ll help Coinbase organize its complex array of products, including its cryptocurrency exchange, wallet, stablecoin, incentivized crypto education platform Earn and Coinbase Commerce that lets businesses take payments in Bitcoin, Ethereum and more. Chatterjee replaces Jeremy Henrickson, the former Coinbase CPO who departed in December 2018.;Surojit is a huge asset here because we;re a product-led company,; Armstrong says. ;We have different leaders and they increasingly have responsibilities around P&amp;L. Having one really experienced chief product officer that can mentor them and teach them to own revenues and budgets ; really in the model of Google ; that will professionalize Coinbase.;One opportunity Armstrong hopes Chatterjee can help Coinbase seize on is building products for emerging markets where financial infrastructure is weak. ;E-commerce is not equally distributed around the world. Micropayments don;t work that well ; Him spending time living in India, a developing market, he deeply understands mobile money.; Given the explosion of phone-based payments, the demonetization and the prevalence of cash on delivery methods in India that Flipkart  dealt with, ;his background is kind of ideal from that worldly perspective,; Armstrong explains.Chatterjee cites his upbringing as inspiration to deliver ;economic freedom for everyone,” as Armstrong says is Coinbase;s mission. ;Growing up in India in a poor middle-class household, I saw very closely what a lack of liquid cash does to a family’s lifestyle,; Chatterjee recalls. ;As a kid I would go with my mom to a local bank to withdraw money. And believe me when I tell you that the process was epic!; It included withdrawal slips, tokens and anxiously trying to match current signatures to versions decades old. When India demonetized and made everyone exchange their cash, ;My dad, who was almost 80 at that time, stood in a queue for five hours to get 2000 Rs, which was the per-day limit for the first week. That’s less than $30!; Digital money could ensure people always have access to everything they own.Surojit Chatterjee (far right) rides along for a Flipkart delivery to understand the consumer commerce experienceIn developed countries, Armstrong sees a chance for Chatterjee to enable digital content creators to turn their passion into their profession. ;There;s lots of people who lurk on Reddit or Stack Overflow and answer questions ; If there was real money on these things, these could be their full time jobs ; contributing content on user-generated social sites,; Armstrong predicts. ;I think you;d see a lot more contributions, as well.;Now might be the perfect time to hire Chatterjee since we’re in a lull period for cryptocurrency in the wake of the rush at the end of 2018. “Crypto is always challenging to navigate. In these periods when it’s relatively quiet, we tend to do really well,” Armstrong says. The company grew market share, volume and app installs versus competitors between 50% and 100%, according to the CEO. Referencing ancient war strategy, Armstrong concludes that, ;There;s years where you just want to train the soldiers and stockpile resources and you;re basically just preparing. We;re building the company, not just responding to crazy hype.;",https://tcrn.ch/2U5ReUN

The intimate gathering of founders, VCs, operators and tech industry experts is all about giving founders the tools they need to find success, no matter the challenge ahead of them.Struggling to understand the legal aspects of running a company, like negotiating cap tables or hiring international talent? We;ve got breakout sessions for that. Wondering how to go about fundraising, from getting your first yes to identifying the right investors to planning the timeline for your fundraise sprint? We;ve got breakout sessions for that. Growth marketing? PR/Media? Building a tech stack? Recruiting?We. Got. You.Hoffman + GuoToday, we;re very proud to announce one of our few Main Stage sessions that will be open to all attendees. Reid Hoffman and Sarah Guo will join us for a conversation around ;How To Raise Your Series A.;Reid Hoffman  is a legendary entrepreneur and investor in Silicon Valley. He was an Executive VP and founding board member at PayPal before going on to co-found LinkedIn in 2003. He led the company to profitability as CEO before joining Greylock in 2009. He serves on the boards of Airbnb, Apollo Fusion, Aurora, Coda, Convoy, Entrepreneur First, Microsoft, Nauto and Xapo, among others. He;s also an accomplished author, with books like ;Blitzscaling,; ;The Startup of You; and ;The Alliance.;Sarah Guo  has a wealth of experience in the tech world. She started her career in high school at a tech firm founded by her parents, called Casa Systems. She then joined Goldman Sachs, where she invested in growth-stage tech startups such as Zynga and Dropbox, and advised both pre-IPO companies (Workday) and publicly traded firms (Zynga,  Netflix and Nvidia). She joined Greylock Partners in 2013 and led the firm;s investment in Cleo, Demisto, Sqreen and Utmost. She has a particular focus on B2B applications, as well as infrastructure, cybersecurity, collaboration tools, AI and healthcare.The format for Hoffman and Guo;s Main Stage chat will be familiar to folks who have followed the investors. It will be an updated, in-person combination of Hoffman;s famously annotated LinkedIn Series B pitch deck that led to Greylock;s investment, and Sarah Guo;s in-depth breakdown of what she looks for in a pitch.They;ll lay out a number of universally applicable lessons that folks seeking Series A funding can learn from, tackling each from their own unique perspectives. Hoffman has years of experience in consumer-focused companies, with a special expertise in network effects. Guo is one of the top minds when it comes to investment in enterprise software.We;re absolutely thrilled about this conversation, and to be honest, the entire Early Stage agenda.How it worksHere;s how it all works:There will be about 50+ breakout sessions at the event, and attendees will have an opportunity to attend at least seven. The sessions will cover all the core topics confronting early-stage founders — up through Series A — as they build a company, from raising capital to building a team to growth. Each breakout session will be led by notables in the startup world.Don’t worry about missing a breakout session, because transcripts from each will be available to show attendees. And most of the folks leading the breakout sessions have agreed to hang at the show for at least half the day and participate in CrunchMatch, TechCrunch’s app to connect founders and investors based on shared interests.Here’s the fine print. Each of the 50+ breakout sessions is limited to around 100 attendees. We expect a lot more attendees, of course, so signups for each session are on a first-come, first-serve basis.

1938476,2020-01-29T08:00:52,"Insurance startup Gabi raises $27M to double its product, engineering and marketing teams","Gabi, a startup built to help consumers save money on home and auto insurance, announced today that it has closed a $27 million Series B.The company intends to use its new capital to rapidly expand its team and invest in its product. Nearly every startup does something similar after it collects new cash, so what makes Gabi;s  round interesting? Its space is attracting lots of capital, it has some notable, venture-backed competitors and its business model helped the company close its latest round. All that made the Gabi deal quite interesting.TechCrunch covered the company;s Series A back in early 2018. The startup has come quite a ways since then. Let;s dig in.The basicsBefore the company;s Series B, Gabi raised a $2.6 million seed round. That 2017-era investment came from SV Angel and A.Capital Ventures. Then, in early 2018, Gabi put together $9.5 million in a Series A led by Canvas Ventures. As you can quickly see, the company;s latest round is larger than its preceding capital raises times two.That makes the $27 million round a big deal for the young company. Mubadala Capital led the event, while prior investors Canvas and others took part. Gabi has now raised $39.1 million in known capital.Finally, before we dig into Gabi, how it works and why that matters, it;s worth noting that the company declined to share any growth metrics. We;d normally complain at this juncture, but its competitor Insurify ; which raised a $23 million Series A earlier this year ; also didn;t share notes on its own growth. Given that they are both now well-funded, we won;t let them not share in the future.Now let;s tie the company;s model to its round.How Gabi worksTechCrunch previously explored the company;s creation and operational history, which lets us instead focus on what it does today. Gabi is what CEO Hanno Fichtner calls a ;tech-enabled broker,; sitting between customers and insurance companies. Its service lets people upload their current policy, which Gabi uses to find cheaper policies for the customer that have similar levels of coverage.If that customer buys a new policy, Gabi gets paid. However, there;s a wrinkle. According to Fichtner, Gabi gets paid again if that customer renews the policy. So, in a sense, Gabi generates recurring revenue. And the better it does at matching consumers with insurance that they buy, and then keep, the more money it can make. (This impact is heightened by the fact that most Gabi customers are existing insurance customers, it told TechCrunch, meaning that they tend to make for more lucrative sign-ups.)All that fits into the Series B when you consider time. Gabi is around three years old, Fichtner told TechCrunch, meaning that its early customer cohorts have only had so much time to mature, and demonstrate retention (renewals); the higher the company;s retention rates proved to be, the more lifetime value (LTV) that Gabi could squeeze from its customers.More simply, the better its retention proved, the more valuable Gabi would be as a business. Which brings us back to its new round.Gabi raised its Series B, from which we can infer that its retention rates were at least pretty good. The company thinks so. Fichtner told TechCrunch that Gabi was able to raise because its ;unit economics are so great.; The CEO went on to say that Gabi has ;proven in the past year that customers like our product, that they are signing up at reasonable customer acquisition costs (CAC) and that the lifetime value (LTV) that we are producing based on retention [is] high enough; to be attractive.So, getting paid off consumer insurance re-ups seems to have made Gabi an attractive receptacle for venture dollars.The insurance gameAccording to Fichtner, Gabi works with a number of the venture-backed insurance companies ; startups like Root Insurance and Lemonade. Regular readers will recall that we;ve inducted two of the three into the $100 million ARR club (more here and here). Fichtner told TechCrunch that they make attractive partners as they are ;quite competitive; and provide strong customer support.Toss in Insurify  and Gabi and there;s a constellation of insurance-focused startups that are raising oodles of ducats. Why? Fichtner left us with a figure that we have to share as it helps answer our question. Guess, if you will, how much money is paid out in the U.S. each year in insurance commissions? $64 billion, for personal (non-corporate) insurance.According to the executive, commissions on such products can be as high as 13%. You can do the math. That;s one heck of a lot of space to sell into.",https://tcrn.ch/2RE1jGZ
1938349,2020-01-29T07:00:41,"Whip Media Group, parent to TV show tracking app TV Time, raises $50M","In the streaming era, data on a show;s viewership and popularity is harder to come by. It;s no longer as simple as setting up a Nielsen box to get data on a show being watched across TVs, phones, tablets and the web. One company solving this problem for content owners, broadcasters and streamers alike is Whip Media Group, parent company to the TV and movie tracking app TV Time. The company announced today it has raised $50 million in Series D funding to continue to grow its business.The round was led by asset management firm Eminence Capital and includes participation from Raine Ventures. To date, Whip Media Group has raised $115 million from Raine Ventures, Eminence, IVP and others.Whip Media Group has a varied history. TV Time began as WhipClip, a source for a legal collection of GIFs from favorite shows. But following the company;s acquisition of French startup TVShow Time in December 2016, it pivoted to become a social TV community. The TV Time app allows users to track their favorite shows by marking episodes as watched, as well as join in the show;s community on the app where users discuss the episode; share photos, screencaps, and memes; take polls; and more. Its recommendations feature also helps users find more things to watch.The company rebranded as Whip Media Group to reflect that it;s now home to a handful of businesses, including the TV Time app, as well as TheTVDB, an entertainment database for TV and movies and, more recently, the content value management platform, Mediamorph.Though consumers only interact with the TV Time app, those engagements help fuel Whip Media Group;s larger business.Today, the TV Time app has anywhere between 800,000 and a million active users per day. And 50% of users contribute some sort of data ; for example, following a show, creating content, liking another user;s post, reviewing an episode, commenting and so on. To date, TV Time has tracked more than 15 billion episodes.Initially, TV Time was using this data to develop a new type of ratings system for the cord-cutting era. But TV Time learned that a show;s ratings don;t matter to video-on-demand services that don;t sell advertising. Instead, what TV Time could provide was emotional data on how users responded to shows.;By collecting [this data] we can build these models to not only say what people are watching, but also start to predict what they;re going to watch next,; says Whip Media Group CEO Richard Rosenblatt.In addition, the engagement data can help streamers find out things they never could before ; like which moment in an episode had huge spikes of user interest, i.e. ;the most memed moment.; This data can help them to better market the show as well as help them think about the show;s direction for future seasons.Now, with the acquisition of Mediamorph, Whip Media Group can also help to value content. This allows buyers and sellers to make determinations about where to sell shows and for how much.This data is highly valuable to Whip Media Group;s clients, which include more than 50 of the biggest names in entertainment ; like Disney, Warner Bros., Hulu, NBCU, Paramount, Sony, Lionsgate, BBC, HBO, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Liberty Global, Discovery and United Talent Agency. (There are other large, household names in streaming that also use the company;s data, but can;t be disclosed due to NDAs.)When a content owner sells a show to a modern-day streaming service, they often have no way of knowing how it performs.Whip Media Group, starting at the end of Q1, will be able to start making predictions about where a particular piece of content available for sale should go, says Rosenblatt.;We will be able to roll out, starting in the first quarter, an ;engagement score,; where [content owners will] actually be able to look at how one piece of content engages a certain demographic or a certain geography differently than another piece of content,; Rosenblatt explains. ;If you think about how ad networks got started 20 years ago ; and you were trying to match the right consumer with the right ad, and all that mattered was if they clicked. Nothing else mattered. Google won because they had the best data, the best models;that;s what we want to do,; he continues.;We want to put the right piece of content on the right platform, in the right country, to the right demographic. And we don;t think that there;s anyone else in this position like we are ; that has all of that between Mediamorph and TV Time,; he says.This data is more important than ever in an era where core classics are selling for as much as half a billion (like the ;Seinfeld; sale to Netflix or ;Friends; to HBO Max) or even more (like the billion-plus-dollar deal for ;Big Bang Theory,; which also went to HBO Max.)More broadly, global online television episode and movie revenues will reach $159 billion in 2024; more than double the $68 billion recorded in 2018, according to Research and Markets.Whip Media Group;s new round of funding is being used, in part, to help pay for the Mediamorph acquisition, which was a combination of cash and stock. But the majority is being used to grow the business, including by expanding the company;s sales and data teams and accelerating product development.The company has already hired 20 people so far and expects to hire 50 by year-end, mostly on the data and engineering sides.;Whip Media Group is building software and data solutions that will transform the way content is being bought and sold throughout the global entertainment ecosystem,” said Ricky Sandler, chief executive officer of Eminence Capital, in a statement. ;We believe in their vision and their exceptional leadership and technology teams and are excited to partner with them as they rapidly expand their business.;",https://tcrn.ch/2O6fVgg
1938975,2020-01-29T07:00:19,Kenshō Health publicly launches its ;antithesis of Goop;,"Last year, when co-founders Danny Steiner and Krista Berlincourt debuted Kenshō Health, their directory and information service for holistic medicine, Berlincourt called it ;the antithesis of Goop.;While Gwyneth Paltrow;s  lifestyle brand startup serves up a heady mix of unverified pseudo-scientific claims alongside longstanding holistic practices, Steiner and Berlincourt focused on the verified and verifiable claims coming out of the medical community.Kenshō, ‘the antithesis of Goop,’  launches a research-based guide to natural medicineThe two founders and their Los Angeles-based team amassed a group of healthcare providers hailing from Stanford University,  Harvard University, Columbia University and others ; all with a concentration on accreditation. Now the service is publicly available and serving up the latest information on holistic medicine ; powered by a partnership with the academic publisher Wiley ; and a verified list of local practitioners for consumers seeking treatments.;We have six points of verification,; says Steiner. ;We look at accreditation, experience, peer reviews, customer reviews, we speak to the providers themselves to make sure we’re on the same page of what we’re trying to provide and for premier providers we do a background check.;That vetting has gone a long way toward providing what the company;s founders say are tens of thousands of beta users with a search and discovery tool for information on holistic health and wellness and direct access to holistic health practitioners. While ;wellness; is a nebulous term often representing therapies with questionable clinical value, it;s a huge business in the U.S. and around the world. Some estimates from industry organizations like the Global Wellness Institute put the dollar value of the industry at roughly $4.2 trillion, encompassing everything from medical tourism to personalized and complementary medicine.The complementary medicine component alone is a $360 billion market opportunity, according to the GWI, and it;s there that Berlincourt and Steiner are focusing their attention.Kenshō Health co-founders Danny Steiner and Krista Berlincourt;We wanted to create something that acted at the right point of intervention,; says Berlincourt, a former public relations professional who launched the business after turning to holistic medicine to treat her chronic adrenal failure. ;So we curated a provider network and made [complementary medicine] easy to understand through research.;The company encourages providers on its platform to offer their services on a sliding scale to improve accessibility and ensure that ;this isn;t only for the wealthy elite,; says Berlincourt.While the service is currently free, both Berlincourt and Steiner say there are obvious paths to making money that the company will explore after it builds out a solid base of users. Various potential revenue streams involve selling treatment or instructional packages or charging for listings on the site.Kenshō;s thesis on a broader market embracing the principles of holistic medicine seems to be supported by recent moves from the nation;s largest public healthcare providers. For the first time, Medicare and Medicaid are now officially covering acupuncture as a verified treatment option for certain conditions, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced last week.There;s also a broader recognition of the role that lifestyle and general health and fitness play in most illnesses, says Berlincourt.;Eighty-seven percent of deaths are related to lifestyle-related disease according to the CDC,; she says. ;And 75% of what we’re spending on healthcare is on the conditions associated with these chronic diseases. We don;t treat the root cause and people don;t know that there are other options.;Now, with the public launch and financial support for investors like CrossCut Ventures, Female Founders Fund  and Evolve Ventures, the company is hoping to create the ;Good Housekeeping seal of approval; for wellness providers, according to Berlincourt.;Conventional medicine wants to play with holistic medicine, but there;s a lack of connection. Our goal is to provide that connection.;",https://tcrn.ch/36DF1tb

They didn’t know what to post or how to make that post really sing.;GoDaddy upgrades its website builder with customized marketing action plansThat;s where Over comes in, offering a variety of customizable templates and layouts that should make it faster and easier to create eye-catching visual content. The goal, according to co-founder and CEO Matt Winn, is to ;build guitars, not violins; — in the same way that someone can pick up a guitar and ;strum a few cords,; they should be able to download Over and quickly ;start creating really great content.;In fact, the startup says it has more than 1 million active users of its own, who are using it to create more than 220,000 projects every day.Tsai said GoDaddy and Over were initially discussing a partnership, but as it became clear that there was an opportunity to integrate the products more deeply, those discussions led to acquisition talks.Over will continue to operate as a standalone app, and he said the team will continue to develop new features for the app. At the same time, they;ll be building integrations with Websites+Marketing, for example by taking Over and connecting it ;into our insights tool to understand how different elements of [online] presence layer in together, to look at templates and how those actually help different types of small business owners.;The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.

1938555,2020-01-29T06:00:01,Mobile messaging startup Attentive raises another $70M,"Less than six months after it announced $40 million in funding, Attentive has raised another $70 million ; this time in Series C funding.The new round was led by Sequoia and IVP, two firms that were part of the Series B. Previous investors Eniac Ventures and NextView Ventures also participated.CEO Brian Long (who, along with his Attentive  co-founder Andrew Jones, sold his previous startup TapCommerce to Twitter) told me that he wasn;t planning to raise money again so soon, but things were going even better than expected, with a client list that has grown to more than 750 businesses, including Coach, Urban Outfitters, CB2, PacSun, Party City and Jack in the Box.Long noted that it;s always smarter to raise money when things are going swimmingly, rather than dealing with the ;not-so-fun process; of trying to raise ;when you really need it.;He added, ;When you see that you’re doing that well, you think, ;Hey, we should hire a lot more people to support this growth.; And then the other piece is just being able to move faster into new areas.;Long attributed the success Attentive has had thus far to the growing importance of text messages as a channel for businesses to reach consumers, particularly as those consumers are less inclined to open marketing emails or download retailers; mobile apps. And in contrast to broader messaging platforms, Long said Attentive is ;focused on just doing this channel right.;He said the platform is designed to solve the main problems faced by retailers trying to build a mobile messaging strategy — first, by helping them create a text subscriber list in a way that complies with regulations, then by offering ;the ability to send messages that frankly aren’t going to piss people off.;;We want the messages to be relevant for the consumer, we want to send them things that they care about,; Long said. ;The package is on the way, real-time customer service, a product that you were looking at recently is on-sale ; there;s a lot of data that you can put to work in order to do it at scale.;Looking ahead, he hopes to expand beyond the United States and Canada, and to move into industries beyond e-commerce — for example, into more traditional retail, and also to start working with colleges that are looking to attract more applicants.“Attentive’s growth is a clear indication that people want to interact with brands in new ways, and brands are embracing messaging as an effective way to reach consumers,” said Sequoia partner Pat Grady in a statement. “We are thrilled to double down on our partnership with Attentive so they can continue to deliver fantastic results for their customers and valuable experiences for consumers.”Attentive has now raised a total of $124 million.Airship acquires A/B testing company Apptimize",https://tcrn.ch/2RB6Q0P
1938971,2020-01-29T05:02:14,"HeyMama, a premium social network for working moms, raises $2 million","As we spend more and more time on our phones, working busier and busier jobs, and leading more and more overwhelming lives, personal connection with others is harder and harder to come by. HeyMama wants to change that.The premium social network is aimed squarely at working mothers, looking to give them a space to connect, communicate and learn from each other. The company has today announced the close of $2 million in seed funding, with investors that include Rebecca Minkoff, Kori Estrada, Kathryn Moos, Janna Meyrowitz Turner, Divya Gugnani, Alison Wyatt, Sari Azout, Kymberly Marciano and Karen Cahn, who were HeyMama  members pre-investment. Keith Belling also invested in the round.HeyMama has several moving pieces, but the biggest and most important is the platform itself. The premium network gives members the chance to post to forums, as well as join and communicate with groups like ;Tech Moms,; ;Single Moms; and ;Moms Who Are Fundraising.; Perhaps most importantly, all members get access to the full HeyMama membership database, giving them the ability to learn more about other members and even email them directly.Interestingly, HeyMama is a bit of a hybrid in terms of the value proposition. Moms can come in and ask about baby food recommendations and hunt for an engineer to join their company all in the same session. Founders Katya Libin and Amri Kibbler say that many members are looking for recommendations, whether they;re for professional or personal purposes.Another piece of the business is HeyMama events. The company holds events in 11 cities across the country and earns revenue via brand partnerships. For example, Lincoln Motor Company is a sponsor for the 2020 mentorship event series.Libin said that the offline component is a huge reason why many moms join, as there is no substitution for face-to-face connection.As an added bonus, HeyMama negotiates membership perks for users, giving them a discount on interesting products and services.The company says that 85% of its members come via word-of-mouth referrals to the network. When new users do submit an application, those applications are vetted by humans. The founders said that the acceptance rate is about 85%, with HeyMama primarily focused on bringing on new members that can also offer help, not just ask for it.HeyMama membership costs $35/month or $349/year.The company did not disclose specific numbers around membership, but did say that it has ;thousands; of members on the platform.HeyMama actually came onto the scene in 2014 in the form of a social media account and online magazine. After realizing that working moms weren;t being served in the best way possible, the company pivoted to a premium social network in 2017, and the rest is history.;This community is for ambitious women who are coming together to support each other,; said Kibbler. ;These women are so incredibly busy, and on HeyMama they can give and get vetted recommendations on everything and know that the responses are coming from women that are like them.;",https://tcrn.ch/38K0rpO

The company is working on an app that lets you seamlessly get a business phone number without a second phone or a second SIM card.Y Combinator, Kindred Ventures, Garage Capital, 122WEST Ventures and others are also participating in today’s funding round.Compared to Aircall and other enterprise solutions, OpenPhone targets small and medium companies that want a mobile-first, easy-to-use solution to take advantage of a second phone number.For instance, if you’re a freelancer and you hate handing out your personal phone number, OpenPhone  lets you separate your personal and professional life more easily.OpenPhone works on iPhone, iPad and Android. You also can use a web interface to interact with the app from your computer. It currently costs $10 per month per user. For that price, you get a local number, a toll-free number or you can port an existing phone number. Five thousand people are using OpenPhone right now.You can then use that number for unlimited calls and texts in the U.S. and Canada. Behind the scene, OpenPhone uses your internet connection to establish voice-over-IP calls.The startup has been working on collaborative features so you can use OpenPhone with multiple users. For instance, you can share a phone number with other users so your team can answer text messages faster and pick up the phone more often. The company has also launched a Slack integration that lets you receive a notification when somebody calls or texts your phone number.",https://tcrn.ch/38PlN5n
1938961,2020-01-29T03:10:12,Bankin’ and Bridge launch payment API using bank transfers,"French startup Bankin’ has introduced Bridge Pay this week, an API that lets you initiate payments using bank transfers from your app. Think about it as a sort of Stripe, but for bank transfers. The API currently covers 12 major French banks, which represent around 90% of retail bank accounts in France.Bankin’ is both a B2B and B2C startup. It operates a popular consumer app that lets you aggregate all your bank accounts in a single app. The company has managed to attract 4 million customers with this app. Bankin’ also manages an API called Bridge. Developers can connect directly with bank accounts to fetch transactions and banking information.With Bridge  Pay, the company wants to go one step further and become a payment API as well. The company has been using Bridge Pay within Bankin’ already — customers can transfer money from one bank account to another in the Bankin’ app. Bankin’ users have transferred €1 billion so far.Third-party companies will now be able to initiate bank transfers themselves. It could be useful for e-commerce companies that sell very expensive items, for instance. For example, if you want to buy expensive airplane tickets or a Mac Pro on Apple’s website, you might reach your card transaction limit.It also opens up a ton of possibilities when it comes to automating B2B transactions without having to interact with your bank account. For instance, payroll services could integrate directly with your company’s bank account to transfer money to your employees.Bridge Pay can be integrated directly in your app or service. When you select payment via bank transfers, you get a list of banks, you then connect to your bank account, choose an account and initiate a payment. Chances are your bank is going to ask you for a confirmation via a text message or a push notification. The company can add more banks in the future without any change in the app.",https://tcrn.ch/36wiZbK
1938623,2020-01-29T00:01:55,"Perdoo adds free tier to its OKR service, adding a fresh wrinkle to an accelerating market","Perdoo, a Berlin-based OKR-focused software startup, has decided to make its basic service free, potentially shaking up its growing, and somewhat crowded, market. ;Objectives and Key Results,; a planning and management technique usually shortened to ;OKRs,; is a hot space for software startups, with several raising in recent months.WorkBoard and Gtmhub, for example, each raised capital for their OKR products in the last two months. WorkBoard raised $30 million, while Gtmhub added $9 million to its coffers. So many companies are operating in the space that TechCrunch created a compendium of sorts listing the players, simply to get our mind around who is active in the space as a partial, or pure participant.Perdoo  is a different animal than its rivals. The company, instead of tapping into an obviously interested venture capital pool, is a largely bootstrapped affair, it told TechCrunch. That makes its decision all the more curious. Why would a company with, theoretically, at least, less room to maneuver, make a portion of its product cost less than before? To understand, we got on the phone with Perdoo co-founder Henrik-Jan van der Pol to dig in.PricingOKR software runs from cheap to expensive, with WorkBoard not listing prices on its website (that we could find while compiling this entry), to $1 per user per month for Gtmhub;s  lowest-priced tier. Most providers in the space offer enterprise offerings that cost more. (Before offering a free tier, Perdoo only charged per user per month for its service, with sliding discounts for volume.)During a call with TechCrunch, van der Pol explained his company;s move to undercut other companies; lower-cost pricing, saying that the OKR market is ;still new for a lot of organizations, meaning that they don;t have a budget available.; Those players, he said, ;start with spreadsheets, which creates a lot of hassle and actually decreases their chances of success.; Those firms that need tooling but didn;t have ready budget open for the cost were why Perdoo ;decided to make that switch to freemium, and give people a solid and free version that they can get started with that has very few limitations,; van der Pol continued.Free Perdoo users can track as many goals as they;d like with as many users as they;d like. According to the co-founder, his company ;looked at what functionality people currently use that build their own [OKR] tools; and decided to give those away.Perdoo isn;t insane, mind. The company is still selling a paid version of its product with more features, and the company must hope that free users convert to its paid service over time.In a sense, the freemium move is a gambit of sorts: By offering functionality for free, perhaps Perdoo can attract to itself users that might not have otherwise selected its service (perhaps choosing a provider with more available capital for marketing expenses) ; users that might convert to paying customers later on, naturally.MoneyAccording to van der Pol, ;in order to sustain a free offer, you need to be cash flow positive and profitable,; telling TechCrunch that his company is both.Here we can see the power of not raising lots of money. Because Perdoo only raised angel money and has paid its own way since, the company can afford (literally) to offer a lot for nothing. It doesn;t have investors shouting over its shoulder about possible cannibalizing its own market, or anything similar.So: Lots of venture dollars are powering several neat startups that are growing like mad, with WorkBoard and Gtmhub posting huge ARR gains in recent years to the tune of hundreds of percent. What impact Perdoo;s move might have on their growth, or product choices, won;t be clear for a while, if it has any at all. But Perdoo did just reprice basic OKR software to zero.In the middle of a venture-capital powered growth war, that;s fascinating.",https://tcrn.ch/2GwZoxB

We’re very inclusive, rather than alienating, and we’re thrilled to be a part of ‘Made By Chicks.’ ”Peabody is one of several entrepreneurs in Los Angeles and beyond looking to upend the market for beverages worldwide ; an industry that;s expected to hit $1.9 trillion, according to data provided by the company. Wine alone is expected to be a roughly $450.5 billion dollar business by 2024, according to Bev.“Legacy brands tend to sexualize alcohol consumption, and objectify women on TV, billboards, and in print,” said Peabody, in a statement. “That’s what we’re changing. We want women to know that drinking can be fun, inclusive and safe.”Together with Peabody, the Fosters will develop media like podcasts, videos and events that center on entrepreneurial women. It;s a format similar to the media property Girlboss, founded by Sophia Amoruso  and now owned by Attention Capital.Stories and advice columns from the new platform will range from topics like asking for a raise to managing a company while pregnant.“When I first met Alix and her team, I immediately gravitated to her incredible founder story, ambition to challenge the alcohol industry’s outdated status quo, and sheer tenacity to spark a movement through an empowering brand like Bev,” shared Simon Tikhman, the CEO and co-founder of The Core Entertainment, a partner of Live Nation, and new Bev brand investor, in a statement. “I also knew by partnering with Bev that I wanted to assemble an unrivaled strategic group with expertise and business acumen in diverse sectors. Erin and Sara Foster, Rich Paul, Keith Sheldon, and Chief Zaruk bring so much to the table.”",https://tcrn.ch/2RzWcYa
1937588,2020-01-28T21:16:35,Kenyan logistics startup Sendy raises $20M round backed by Toyota,"Africa;s logistics startup space has gained another multi-million-dollar round with global backing.Kenyan company Sendy — with an on-demand platform that connects clients to drivers and vehicles for goods delivery — has raised a $20 million Series B led by Atlantica Ventures.Toyota Tsusho Corporation, a trade and investment arm of Japanese automotive company Toyota, also joined the round.Sendy;s  raise comes within six months of Nigerian trucking logistics startup Kobo360;s $20 million Series A backed by Goldman Sachs. In November, East African on-demand delivery venture Lori Systems hauled in $30 million supported by Chinese investors.Those companies have plotted Africa expansions into each other;s markets and broader Africa. With its latest round, Sendy ups its competitive stance in the continent;s startup logistics space. The company plans to expand to West Africa in 2020, CEO Mesh Alloys told TechCrunch on a call.Alloys co-founded Sendy in 2015 with Kenyans Evanson Biwott and Don Okoth and American Malaika Judd. The startup currently has offices in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, with 5,000 vehicles on its platform that move all sorts of goods, according to Alloys.Sendy offers services for e-commerce, enterprise, and freight delivery for a client list that includes Unilever,  DHL, Maersk,  Safaricom  and African online retailer Jumia.The company uses an asset-free model, with an app that coordinates contract drivers who own their own vehicles, while confirming deliveries, creating performance metrics and managing payment.On Sendy;s business and revenue model, ;We take a percentage of each transaction. We also facilitate services for drivers like insurance, health insurance, vehicle financing, vehicle servicing and fuel credits,; said Alloys.The company plans to use its Series B funding for new hires and to upgrade its tech. ;Getting better operational efficiency is super key, so we;ll invest;in engineering teams and data teams;and deploying talent to improve the services that we give our customers,; said Alloys.Sendy;s $20 million round includes an R&amp;D arrangement with Toyota Tsusho Corporation, whose investment comes from a venture arm the company established for Africa, called Mobility 54.;We;ll look at optimizing the kind of trucks that perform well in this market; they;ll also look at setting up vehicle services centers in partnership with us,; said Alloys.Asia Africa Investment, Sunu Capital, Enza Capital, Vested World and Kepple Capital joined lead investor Atlantica Ventures on the $20 million round — which brings Sendy;s total funding to $29 million, according to Alloys.Formed in 2019, Atlantica Ventures is a relatively new Africa focused VC fund co-founded by Washington, DC based Aniko Szigetvari. She confirmed the fund;s lead on Sendy;s Series B and that Atlantica Ventures will take a board seat and work on strategic planning and execution with the company.On how Sendy will outpace rivals such as Kobo360  and Lori Systems,  Alloys points to the startup;s platform. ;Our customer service is superior and that;s driven by our technology; I think we;re miles ahead of our competition today when it comes to tech,; he said.Whoever surges ahead, Africa;s top business hubs — Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana — stand to gain from the innovation VC spending and startup rivalry bring to the on-demand goods delivery sector.Though logistics services aren;t included in the World Bank;s ease of doing business country rankings, they;re known to be costlier in Africa than many parts of the world.In the early days of online commerce development on the continent — due to a lack of viable 3PL options — pioneering e-commerce startups Jumia and Konga were forced to burn capital by forming their own delivery services.Years later, after Jumia listed on the NYSE and expanded to multiple countries in Africa, fulfillment costs related to delivery remain one of the company;s largest expenses.Lowering logistics expenses for businesses in Africa is central to Sendy;s mission, according to Alloys.;We;re organizing a marketplace using technology so companies can efficiently deliver to their customers while reducing overall costs,; he said.Jumia, DHL and Alibaba will face off in African e-commerce 2.0",https://tcrn.ch/36w5RmR
1938501,2020-01-28T13:55:51,"Product Hunt launches beta of YourStack, a home for your favorite things","The team behind Product Hunt  is launching a new social network called YourStack, a platform aiming to connect people that are passionate about products and help them discover what things their friends love.;It;s super simple, you just search through and create a stack of products you love,; Product Hunt founder Ryan Hoover tells TechCrunch. ;We wanted to make sure it wasn;t just software, but also games and books and beauty products, you name it.;YourStack;s catalog doesn;t have every product under the sun, but if it;s a tech object, startup service, app or direct-to-consumer thing, chances are you can ;stack; it. Once you add it to your profile, you can write a quick little descriptor and also share some tips and tricks you;ve learned about the product in question.Product Hunt was acquired by AngelList just over three years ago, and since then Hoover and company have grown the platform into a go-to hub for makers looking to launch tech products. The team of 20 is now splitting their time between Product Hunt and YourStack, hoping that the new venture can lead to a platform that;s more centered on people and the products they use. While a social network based entirely around the multi-national brands that people love is something I;d love to hear Bernie Sanders; thoughts on, it;s clear there;s an open opportunity here.Social media platforms like Instagram have given influencers a huge platform for paid product endorsements, but because there;s so much schilling, consumers can;t put a ton of trust in the recommendations. Platforms like Twitter have been great for this inside the tech industry, but there;s no UI for it, so you sort of have to be at the right place at the right time, and, furthermore, the tech folks who have these great product insights are too busy being thought leaders.If YourStack takes off, who knows what it could eventually become, but the goal seems to be to let users gain access to more personal product recommendations. On the product creator side, Hoover believes YourStack could give some great qualitative data that allows makers to understand how customers are using what they;ve built.The product is in beta right now with a waitlist that;s already a few thousand users deep, but Hoover says the goal right now is to gather feedback.;With a lot of social products, you don;t know how people are going to use them when they first start,; Hoover tells TechCrunch. ;We actually had a very similar approach when we launched Product Hunt, where we let more and more people onto it each day and that was really effective in letting it slowly grow rather than leading people to a bad experience.;",https://tcrn.ch/2RA30VS
1937198,2020-01-28T13:09:11,Essential advice for securing your small startup,"Jeff Bezos’ phone was hacked. And if the richest person in the world is vulnerable, chances are good that your startup could get hacked, too.The good news is that, as a tiny company, you’re not a big target. But as soon as you hire your first employee, it’s time to think about adopting basic security practices to ensure that you’re less vulnerable. Nothing is perfectly secure on the internet, but you can mitigate risk.When you have fewer than 10 employees, you don’t want to use a single sign-on service like Okta. Solutions that work great for companies with tens of thousands of employees are not practical because they’re not designed for you.As a basic rule, you want things to be simple by design. Relying on fewer services will reduce your attack surface, and if people can follow rules without even thinking about them, your organization will be less vulnerable. You might be great at spotting phishing attempts and securing your own accounts, but your startup is only as secure as your least-savvy employee. Most security issues come from human error.",https://tcrn.ch/2RWxHn1
1938452,2020-01-28T10:58:53,Free Agency wants to give every tech worker a career and salary boost,"Labor markets, particularly those in the tech industry, are incredibly lopsided against employees. Companies screen, interview, and negotiate with thousands of candidates per year, while employees may only go through recruiting a handful of times in their lives. Inevitably, they can select the wrong positions, pick the wrong managers to work with, and end up with a salary well below market rate.New York City-based Free Agency wants to become the advocate of choice for this high-priced talent. Taking its cue from Hollywood and the sports world, the growing startup wants to identify great workers and offer them the career counseling, interview guidance, and salary negotiation prowess to let them do their best work — and at the right wage.The company, which was founded last year by Sherveen Mashayekhi and Alex Rothberg, exclusively told TechCrunch that it has now reached 100 “Free Agents” on its platform, and it also announced that it has netted a combined $5.35 million in seed investments led by Resolute Ventures  and Bloomberg Beta last year.The way Free Agency works is simple. In exchange for the service’s help in finding and negotiating a career change, the startup takes 5-10% of its client’s first-year salary at their new company. As an example, given that median tech salaries at top companies have hovered around $200,000, that would be a fee of $10,000-$20,000.That may sound exorbitant, but for the founders of Free Agency, it is anything but. They believe that many employees regularly fail to find the most ideal companies to work for and to negotiate the best salaries, which means that a significant amount of money is being left on the table by their potential clients.Free Agency founders Alex Rothberg, COO, and Sherveen Mashayekhi, CEO. Photo via Free Agency.“Our business model keeps us incentive-aligned with the candidate, driven by outcomes rather than upfront fees,” Mashayekhi, who is CEO, explained to me. “But it’s also important to note that Free Agency is, philosophically, also aligned with what employers want. Happy candidates who feel fairly paid will remain at their jobs longer and contribute more productivity. We help make happy candidates.”Free Agency is in many ways a parallel to the rise of income-share agreements (ISAs) in the edtech world, which my colleague Eric Peckham has written about extensively in recent months. In lieu of tuition, some new education startups are using ISAs as a way to guarantee better employment outcomes for students while limiting their debt burden. Their growing popularity has spawned significant investor interest.WTF are ISAs and can they transform education and spark a startup wave?Today, Free Agency is barely one year old with just about 11 employees on the payroll. Longer term though, it wants to manage the budding careers of tech workers in much the way that Hollywood agents often do — finding new projects to work on, helping its talent develop their own skills, brands, and thought leadership, and helping them network with key decision-makers so they get called upon when great new opportunities arise.“Today, we’re focused primarily on the job search inflection point, but Free Agency is really a career-long partner. You’ll see us continue to add ways to help our Free Agents succeed along 5 or 10 years of partnerships through intentional career management,” Mashayekhi said.Talent agents exist in industries like Hollywood, book publishing, and sports because the talent themselves often don’t want to take on the burdens of managing their own careers. Film directors and baseball pitchers want to practice and hone their craft, not spend hours negotiating with studio execs and club owners. Agents also are more up-to-date on industry salary trends, and also where new opportunities are arising. Plus, they often work with talent managers to optimize all the ancillary revenues that comes from these careers (product endorsements, speaker engagements, etc.)Furthermore, these industries have extremely strong superstar income patterns, where top talent can easily make tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of a career.While the tech industry has traditionally not had agents, tech talent is increasingly having similar superstar properties. Star engineers, product managers, and designers can make tens of millions of dollars across salary and equity packages, and often have a range of ancillary revenue sources from consulting engagements with VC firms to lecture circuit payments. Even better, new talent is often making six-figures, whereas the early years in an entertainment or sports career is often focused on securing any paying job.What remains to be see is whether engineers will willingly give up a segment of their income in order to get better career help. Certainly Free Agency is not the first company that has tried to tackle this emerging field. 10x Management is a talent agency that has focused on vetting top freelance developers, and was profiled in The New Yorker a few years ago. Other startups have also entered the space over the past decade.Free Agency believes it has the timing and service quality to win this market. While it is early days, much like the excitement around ISAs in education, I expect models like Free Agency to increasingly become popular as a way to manage our careers, and this is one startup worth paying attention to in the coming years.In addition to Resolute and Bloomberg, Ludlow Ventures,  Background Capital, Parker Thompson, Will Oberndorf, Amrit Saxena, Jenny Fielding, Greg Schroy, Gordon Wintrob, and Orrick LLP also joined the round as investors.How income share agreements will spark the rise of career accelerators",https://tcrn.ch/2O3ssAL

1938373,2020-01-28T09:05:50,Securiti.ai scores $50M Series B to modernize data governance,"Securiti.ai, a San Jose startup, is working to bring a modern twist to data governance and security. Today the company announced a $50 million Series B led by General Catalyst, with participation from Mayfield.The company, which only launched in 2019, reports it has already raised $81 million. What is attracting all of this investment in such a short period of time is that the company is going after a problem that is an increasing pain point for companies all over the world because of a growing body of data privacy regulation like GDPR and CCPA.These laws are forcing companies to understand the data they have, and find ways to be able to pull that data into a single view, and, if needed, respond to customer wishes to remove or redact some of  it. It;s a hard problem to solve with customer data spread across multiple applications, and often shared with third parties and partners.Company CEO and founder Rehan Jalil says the goal of his startup is to provide an operations platform for customer data, an area he has coined PrivacyOps, with the goal of helping companies give customers more control over their data, as laws increasingly require.;In the end it;s all about giving individuals the rights on the data: the right to privacy, the right to deletion, the right to redaction, the right to stop the processing. That;s the charter and the mission of the company,; he told TechCrunch.You begin by defining your data sources, then a bot goes out and gathers customer data across all of the data sources you have defined. The company has links to more than 250 common modern and legacy data sources out of the box. Once the bot grabs the data and creates a central record, humans come in to review the results and make any adjustments and final decisions on how to handle a data request.It has a number of security templates for different kinds of privacy regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA, and the bot finds data that must meet these requirements and lets the governance team see how many records could be in violation or meet a set of criteria you define.Securiti.ai data view. Screenshot: Securiti.ai (cropped)There are a number of tools in the package, including ways to look at your privacy readiness, vendor assessments, data maps and data breaches to look at data privacy in broad way.The company launched in 2019, and in just five months has already grown to 185 employees, a number that is expected to increase in the next year with the new funding.",https://tcrn.ch/2tWxJn3

The company is working with partners, including the Canadian Space Agency and the University of Toronto, on the new facility, which will also incorporate design and development of its satellites in addition to manufacturing.Already, Kepler operates two satellites currently in orbit, and has demonstrated the capabilities of its technology by delivering a high-speed internet data connection to the North Pole for the first time late last year. These spacecraft were designed by Kepler, but manufactured via third-parties through contracting agreements. With the new facility, Kepler says it;ll be able to ;vertically integrate the development, production and testing of its future spacecraft.;This will help the startup achieve its goal of producing, launching and operating a constellation of 140 satellites in total, which will provide high-bandwidth connectivity aimed for use in a range of industries, including agriculture, transportation and maritime shipping and logistics, to name a few. This new in-house facility will support mass production of the small satellites it requires to build out its fleet, while providing cost benefits versus outsourcing over time.The small satellite industry is one of the parts of commercial space that has seen the biggest increase in demand, especially since relatively affordable launch vehicles like SpaceX;s  Falcon 9 have expanded the pool of potential companies building and operating satellites and constellations. Bringing satellite manufacturing in-house puts Kepler in rare company as one of the few small sat companies that owns the whole stack, which should be a big competitive advantage relative to the market going forward.In terms of when the facility will be putting out satellites that Kepler plans to actually launch, the company currently plans to launch its final demonstration satellite, which is already built under its prior contractor arrangement, this spring. Then, it intends to launch the first commercial satellites produced by this new facility starting this summer, with an additional two launches planned for later in the year.",https://tcrn.ch/3aR17vu

The companies did not share terms of the deal.With Passage AI,  ServiceNow  gets a bushel of AI talent, which in itself has value, but it also gets AI technology, which should fit in nicely with ServiceNow;s mission. For starters, the company;s chatbot solutions gives ServiceNow an automated way to respond to customer/user inquiries.Even more interesting for ServiceNow, Passage includes an IT automation component that uses ; a conversational interface to submit tickets, handle queries and take direct action through APIs,; according to the company website. It also gets an HR automation piece, giving the company an intelligent tool it could incorporate across its Now Platform in tools like ServiceNow Virtual Agent and Service Portal, as well as Workspaces in multiple languages.The multilingual support was an aspect of the deal that appeals to Debu Chatterjee, senior director of AI Engineering at ServiceNow. ;Building deep learning, conversational AI capabilities into the Now Platform will enable a work request initiated in German or a customer inquiry initiated in Japanese to be solved by Virtual Agent,; he said in a statement.Companies are increasingly looking for ways to solve common customer problems using chatbots, while only bringing humans into the loop when the bot can;t answer the query. Passage AI gives ServiceNow much deeper knowledge in this growing area.Passage AI, which launched in 2016, has raised $10.3 million, according to Crunchbase data. The company website lists a variety of large customers, including Mastercard, Shell, Mercedes-Benz and SoftBank. The acquisition comes less than a week after the company purchased another AI-focused startup, Loom Systems, one that concentrates on automating operations data.The deal is expected to close this quarter.

Antony Brydon, who co-founded the company with Jeff Patterson (currently head of product), is moving over from the CEO role to become head of platform, where he will focus on how and where to take Directly;s  technology beyond its current market focus on chatbots built for customer service.The idea is to hand over the focus on business growth to an expert, while giving a company founder the chance to help figure out how best to focus the company to forge into newer areas.;We are thrilled to have Mike at the helm of Directly,” Mark Selcow, partner at Costanoa Ventures, said in a statement. “He has driven record-setting growth for the company in 2019, and we look forward to the impact he;s going to have into 2020 and beyond.”Brydon and de la Cruz have known each other since college, which speaks to a long friendship and trust in each other, too ; a good sign, in my opinion.The valuation is not being disclosed, except Brydon and de la Cruz, in a joint interview this week, confirmed to TechCrunch that it is north of $100 million. When this round was being raised, PitchBook data noted that the valuation was $110 million, which roughly lines up with that.They added that the idea is that this funding was opportunistic ; Samsung is a customer, along with biggies like Microsoft (also a strategic investor), and Airbnb (not an investor!). The bigger plan is to raise a much larger Series C round in 2021 ; which implies it has enough runway for at least the next year.Directly has emerged at a key time in the world of customer service, and in AI.Although call centres are still a fundamental cornerstone of how businesses interface with users, the rise of social media and messaging services has created an opportunity to complement and in some cases replace how those more traditional channels work.While in many cases human agents are still at the other end of those messaging-based, text-based conversations, sometimes you only might think they are; or when they really are, they are still using a lot of AI tools to help them be as informative as they can be.That;s where Directly comes into the picture. While there may be some true superstars in the world of customer service who know the product they are representing backwards and forwards, chances are that the vast majority of people helping customers are not omniscient gurus, and are just human like the people complaining or asking questions.Directly has therefore built a platform that helps businesses identify and reach out to ;experts; in the business or product in question, collect knowledge from them, and then fold that into a company;s AI to help train it and answer questions more accurately. It also looks at data input and output into those AI systems to figure out what is working, and what is not, and how to fix that, too.The information is typically collected by way of question-and-answer sessions, and Directly has even built a way to compensate these experts both for submitting information as well as to pay out royalties when their knowledge has been put to use, ;just as you would in traditional copyright licensing in music,; Brydon noted.This system is used for technical support for games ; Microsoft uses it to power its Xbox assistant for example ; or devices, or for those who are engaging in building businesses on platforms, such as in the case of Airbnb providing an assistant to hosts to help answer questions about how to list on the platform.At a time when we are talking a lot about bias in AI and other pitfalls of how these systems are trained, a company that is working on ways of giving the best shot possible, by limiting the training data just to what is most likely to be correct and verifiable, is an interesting prospect that lines up with the approaches that companies like Samasource and others focused on ethical AI are taking.It seems ironic, however, that tech giants like Microsoft and Samsung, which have put a significant amount of investment into acquiring businesses and organically building their own customer-facing AI systems ; Samsung;s Bixby is built in part through the acquisition of Viv and a multitude of other related deals; ditto Microsoft;s Cortana ; would rely on another company to help these along. But the role that Directly occupies somewhat sits outside the core technology, which needs computer vision, natural language processing, a larger machine learning engine and more to process all of the inbound data.Training those AI systems ; the area that Directly is focusing on ; is likely to remain a key area for how these are used and developed, as it could be many years before we see what Brydon refers to as the ;Holy Grail,; a general AI that can do the training for itself and work across a diverse range of fields and specific interests.In the meantime, it can take as little as 100 experts, but potentially many more, to train a system, depending on how much the information needs to be updated over time. The Xbox implementation, for example, includes 1,000 experts, but has to date answered around 2 million questions (and will likely answer multiples of that as games and consoles get updated).The longer-term picture is that Directly is likely to work with a growing number of businesses as the use of chatbots continues to expand among organisations.With that bigger trend, it;s also likely to run into some of the biggest players in consumer information, like Google and Amazon. Neither are customers of Directly yet ; and truth be told, they might just as easily end up competitors ; but it makes for an interesting prospect, as AI finally starts to get more intelligent.&nbsp;",https://tcrn.ch/2voQLCQ
1938188,2020-01-28T06:12:55,Scroll launches its subscription offering ad-free access across 300 partner sites,"After a long period of invite-only beta testing, Scroll is officially launching today, offering ad-free access to sites like BuzzFeed News, Business Insider, Salon, Slate and Vox for an introductory price of $2.49 per month.CEO Tony Haile  previously led analytics company Chartbeat, and he said he founded Scroll  because of his frustration with the way news sites were becoming dragged down by ads and trackers — and despite those performance-slowing/privacy-defying practices, publications were still struggling to make money.;Basically, we were trying to think through: How would the internet have evolved if it didn;t have to rely on ads [from the start]?,; Haile said. ;What would the economics look like?;The solution that he and his team came up with is a subscription where consumers pay (the price is starting at $2.49 per month for the first six months after launch, then goes up to $4.99 per month) for ;a web that;s twice as fast, with no shadowy trackers, no ads, no pre-rolls.; Publishers, meanwhile, make more money than they would have by showing ads to those same visitors.The consumer experience may resemble what you can already get with an ad blocker, but Haile said it offers a few key advantages. For one thing, you won;t run into the issues you currently might on partner sites that detect ad blockers. For another, it works smoothly on mobile — once you;ve logged into your account on the Scroll site, you should be able to visit any of the partner sites and view them without ads, and you can also read via the Scroll mobile app.Plus, there;s what Haile described as the ;good karma; of knowing that you;re supporting the publishers behind the news and stories that you actually read.He noted that every reader;s payment is dispersed separately, based on their own ;engagement and loyalty,; rather than putting all of the subscription revenue into a single pool. So your money will never go to a site that you;ve never visited — and you;ll even get a monthly report showing which publishers your money is supporting.Haile said Scroll has already signed up around 300 partners. (TechCrunch isn;t one of them, but I hope that changes.) The startup estimates that a normal page view brings in only $0.011 through advertising, versus $0.016 with Scroll. And the startup also offers a revenue calculator to help publishers confirm that they won;t be losing money.Speaking of publishers, Haile said he;s trying to bring a ;broader range of sites; into Scroll, representing a similarly broad range of viewpoints — again, because the money isn;t going into a single pool, you don;t have to worry about supporting a site that you don;t like (unless you;re doing a lot of hate clicking and reading).Still, he will be exercising some editorial judgment: ;I’m too fucking old to deal with Nazis. I don;t want to give them money.;Of course, many (non-Nazi) publishers are also experimenting with their own paywalls and subscriptions. Haile argued that Scroll is complementary to those efforts, because it allows publishers to offer a better experience to readers and make more money from them, even if they;re not yet ;superfans; who are ready to sign up for that specific subscription.;We don’t get in the way of that,; Haile said. ;We’re trying to solve that other problem, to make the internet not suck.;Subscription startup Scroll acquires news aggregator Nuzzel",https://tcrn.ch/37Ld6bW
1938184,2020-01-28T06:11:55,"With Tony Fadell;s help, Advano is building battery components to power an electric future","Using scrap silicon as its feedstock, a New Orleans-based company called Advano has raised $18.5 million to manufacture battery components to enable more powerful, smaller and longer-lasting batteries.The technology was innovative enough to earn the Louisiana-based startup a place in Y Combinator;s  famed accelerator and has now attracted the attention of Mitsui Kinzoku, which is investing in the company as a strategic partner, and Tony Fadell,  the famous product designer known as ;the father of the iPod; and the founder of the smart thermostat company, Nest .Alongside Mitsui;s SBI Material Innovation Fund, Fadell;s investment firm Future Shape,  along with PeopleFund, Thiel Capital, Data Collective and Y Combinator, are investing $18.5 million in new financing to develop Advanos manufacturing capacity and take its silicon anode material to market.“Adding silicon to li-ion batteries can 10x their run-time. Imagine eliminating ;range anxiety;: more EVs, less CO2. But no one has been able to solve four key issues concurrently: material expansion, cycle-life, cost, and drop-in manufacturing scalability,; said Fadell, in a statement. ;Advano’s battery experts are the first to successfully tackle them all. In addition, Advano’s unconventional full-stack approach allows for the battery customization manufacturers require. Plus, they’re using sustainably-sourced silicon to combat the environmental effects of our transition to electric everything! Advano’s innovative work with silicon is the holy grail for batteries.;Advano reuses scrap silicon thanks to a novel materials science process that Advano founder and chief executive Alexander Girau first developed as a student at Tulane University.Other companies, like Sila Nanotechnologies, have raised significant amounts of money to develop ways to integrate silicon into the battery production.Sila Nano;s battery tech is now worth over $1 billion with Daimler partnership and $170 million investmentBasically, batteries consist of anodes, where current flows into a battery; electrolytes, which conduct electricity; and cathodes, where current flows out. In a lithium-ion battery, anodes are typically made using graphite, which has limitations related to how much charge it can store. By replacing graphite with silicon, batteries should be able to store more energy, requiring less material, thereby reducing cost and size, according to Advano.Girau began his studies in molecular engineering and initially started working on gene therapies. The initial technology that the executive developed focused on creating surface functionalization in nanoparticles, allowing those particles to behave in novel ways.The innovation was taking that research from biology and porting it over into materials science and battery development. The process typically requires several steps to create the functional nanoparticles and attach them to silicon, but Advano;s founder says his company has developed a single-step process.For Advano, the key is attaching a reactive nanoparticle to silicon scrap as those scraps are being crushed. Using that process, the company is able to produce functional silicon, according to Girau.;We can improve the performance of any lithium-ion battery,; says Girau. ;We’re working with consumer electronic battery manufacturers first because the volumes are smaller and we can service those customers sooner.;",https://tcrn.ch/2t0Jpoe
1938154,2020-01-28T06:00:37,Cooks Venture raises $4 million from Golden West Food Group to ramp up distribution,"Cooks Venture, the agtech company looking to revolutionize the chicken industry, has today announced the close of a $4 million funding round led by Golden West Food Group.Cooks Venture  has been working in stealth for many years, but launched onto the scene in 2018 with a plan to reshape agriculture from the ground up. And the key to that strategy? Chickens.Cooks Venture geneticists and scientists have spent years isolating genetic lines of chickens to create a new, proprietary breed, called the Pioneer, a type of heirloom chicken. Most folks don;t know that, no matter what brand of chicken you buy at the store, chances are it;s one of two breeds, the Cobb 500 or the Ross 308, which are produced by Cobb and Aviagen, respectively.Both of these breeds of broilers are fast-growing (they;re ready to be processed in just over five weeks) and use a three-phase feed system for growth. This system, and these breeds, are a big reason why animal activist groups express so much concern over the well-being of chicken livestock, often explaining that the birds are too young to carry around all the weight they put on so quickly.Cooks Venture looked to science to solve the problem. The company;s Pioneer chicken can eat a highly diverse diet, and can be raised in 60 to 65 days. This means that the Pioneer chickens are truly free range, wandering around the farm. It also means that these chickens, with a digestive tract that can handle a diverse diet and the ability to exercise, live a healthier life, are higher in Omega-3 and taste better than your average Cobb 500 or Ross 308, according to the company.But the chickens themselves are only part of the solution. A byproduct of the proliferation of these fast-growing chickens produced by Cobb and Aviagen is that they have to eat, and their diet is very specific. That means that farmers must produce a great deal of one or two crops to feed the millions of chickens out there. The result is that our agricultural land is not being used in an efficient or eco-friendly way.In fact, Cooks Venture founder Matt Wadiak says that the vast majority of our crop production in the United States is used for ethanol or animal feed, which indexes toward corn and soy. The USDA says, of feed grains, that corn accounts for more than 95% of total production and use in the country.Many farmers would love to implement regenerative agricultural practices, a big part of which includes creating a biodiverse ecosystem with many different crops, but who would they sell the extra, low-demand crops to?Cooks Venture picks up $12 million to rethink agriculture from the ground upThe answer now can be Cooks Venture. With strong digestive systems, Cooks Venture chickens can eat a diet that comes from a more biodiverse farm. Moreover, when Cooks Venture is ready to expand globally, the chickens are able to eat crops local to the ecosystems of emerging nations, such as yucca and quinoa.Cooks Venture has its own farm, and works with farm partners to set up regenerative agricultural practices around producing Pioneer chicken feed. Cooks also does its own processing at its own plant.Golden West Food Group is a manufacturer of meat products and value-add food products like marinated chicken, such as Jack Daniel;s pulled pork. It;s worth noting that GWFG is not a competitor to Cooks Venture, as it produces no meat products whatsoever, but rather an important distribution partner for the brand.Through the partnership with GWFG, Cooks can start to ramp up commercialization of its chickens, which are currently sold through some retailers, on the Cooks website and on FreshDirect.As part of the announcement, Cooks Venture is also bringing on Ankur Agrawal as chief financial officer. Wadiak, a co-founder at Blue Apron, worked with Agrawal back in the Blue Apron, days and says that his understanding of agricultural finance is top of the line.Editor;s Note: An earlier version of this article misidentified the Pioneer chicken and mistook HelloFresh for FreshDirect. It has been updated for accuracy.",https://tcrn.ch/2O0uge3
1938161,2020-01-28T05:24:14,Pecan.ai launches with $11M Series A to automate machine learning,"Pecan.ai, a startup that wants to help business analysts build machine learning models in an automated fashion, emerged from stealth today and announced an $11 million Series A.The round was led by Dell Technologies Capital  and S Capital. Along with a previously unannounced $4 million seed round, the company has raised a total of $15 million.CEO Zohar Bronfman says he and co-founder Noam Brezis, whom he has known for more than a decade, started the company with the goal of building an automated machine learning platform. They observed that much of the work involved in building machine learning models is about getting data in a form that the algorithm can consume, something they;ve automated in Pecan.;The innovative thing about Pecan is that we do all of the data preparation and data, engineering and data processing, and [complete the] various technical steps [for you],; Bronfman explained.The target user is a business analyst using business intelligence and analytics tools, who wants to bring the power of machine learning to their data analysis, but lacks the skills to do it. ;The business analyst knows the data very well, knows the business problem very well and speaks directly to the business owner of the problem ; and they are currently conducting basic analytics,; he said.Pecan includes a series of templates designed to answer common business questions. They divide these into two main categories. The first is customer questions like how much churn do we have, and the second is business operations questions related to things like risk or fraud. If the question doesn;t fall into one of these categories, it is possible to build your own template, but Bronfman says that is really for more advanced users.Pecan template catalog and screen pulling churn data from various data sources (Photo: Pecan.ai)After you select the template and point to a data source such as a database, data lake or CRM repository, Pecan does the work of connecting to the source and pulling data into a dashboard. You can also export the algorithm for use in an external service or application, or Pecan can automatically update a data repository with data the algorithm is measuring, such as churn rate.The founders have been building this platform since 2016, when they founded the company, and have been working with beta customers for the last 18 months or so. Today, they emerge from stealth and bring Pecan to market in earnest.Bronfman plans to move to New York City and open a sales and marketing office in the U.S., while Brezis will remain in Tel Aviv and oversee engineering. It;s early days for this startup, but with $11 million in capital, it has a chance to take the product to market and see what happens.",https://tcrn.ch/3135j6N
1938151,2020-01-28T04:21:22,Frontify raises $22.3M to help businesses manage how their brands and logos get used,"The rise of design tools like Canva and the vast expanse of digital spaces where a company;s name can appear these days have created a challenge for organisations: how best to make sure that what gets used is up to date and in keeping with how you want it to be used.Today a ;brand management; startup is announcing some funding to continue building out a business that it hopes will help them. Frontify, a startup originally founded in Switzerland and now co-headquartered in New York, has raised $22.3 million in funding to continue its international expansion and to continue developing technology for its SaaS platform, which lets organisations create image repositories and brand management guidelines, and helps them manage any kind of brand-related project work.The funding ; at an undisclosed valuation ; is being led by EQT Ventures,  with participation also from previous investors Blossom Capital, Datartis Ventures, Thomas Dübendorfer, Tenderloin Ventures and Myke Näf. The company had previously raised $8.3 million in 2018. Frontify  has been around since 2013, but this round comes on the heels of some strong growth: the company now has more than 2,500 customers, with notable ;brands; including Facebook, Dyson, Centrica, Lufthansa, Vodafone and Allianz.“With a rapidly growing worldwide customer base, we continue to see validation in our platform and the niche we’ve established in the market,” said Roger Dudler, the founder and CEO, in a statement. “Increasing our footprint across Europe, cracking the code to the US market, continuing to innovate on our product and shaping brand on an even deeper level than before; these are the kind of initiatives we forecast championing together.”The company;s evolution speaks to the opportunity in the market: It started out by providing a repository to customers, a way for them to organise and update brand assets in an easy way and then integrate that into their websites. That in itself was useful since the kind of ordering and managing needed for that was not necessarily what those businesses would have already had in place and would have needed more dedicated time for product to build from the ground up, and that led to a number of outdated assets in circulation.;I experienced firsthand the increasing number of tools emerging in the marketing and product development space, but for some reason, the coordination of brand assets remained a real challenge,; said Ted Persson, operating partner and investment advisor at EQT Ventures, in a statement. “People would still insist on sending around outdated PDFs, Illustrator files, and fonts. The Frontify team has built a delightful product, enabling everyone to access the most up-to-date brand assets as and when they need to, and the company already has a stellar customer base.”Over time, that expanded as the use of logos and other design assets across a wider array of use cases have led to a subsequent expansion in Frontify;s target users, from designers to brand, marketing, design, developer and communications professionals. And now the company is moving deeper into the next stage of how brand assets get used by providing tools to help with projects using said assets.Its place in the market is still relatively ahead of its time, it seems.;We mainly face players from the fragmented DAM market, which we think is not a very outcome-driven category yet, because it;s mainly a storage for assets,; said Dudler in an interview. ;We think of a new, more holistic category called brand management. While companies start to invest more and more into their brand, starting with a purpose, they are looking for sophisticated tools that fit perfectly into their existing ecosystems, which will eventually enable anyone at a company to create branded content easily. This element of trust people want for their brands has become very complex with the large number of touchpoints. We see kind of consolidation in the market going on, combined with the strong demand from all industries, we see the need of brand management solutions rising massively.;For now, the company does offer some integrations ; currently with Figma, Sketch and Adobe XD ; but it doesn;t see an expanding list of these as part of its growth strategy. ;We think design tools might change rather quickly [while] the single source of truth for all brand resources will stay,; Dudler added. ;That;s why we bridge that gap by integrating with as many existing tools as possible.; He notes that the new templating features that the company has added to expand beyond basic digital asset management ;bring Canva-like functionality to brands with a much more targeted offering for complex enterprise needs.;One thing Frontify is not doing yet, but I suspect would be an interesting product, would be to create a way to track where and when those brand assets are getting used, and conversely to figure out when outdated logos and other assets are appearing. Given the millions that businesses and other organisations spend on the efforts to create the designs and logos in the first place, tracking to make sure they actually get used, and used the right way, seems a logical step.",https://tcrn.ch/2tOj0L0
1937746,2020-01-28T03:37:55,Chicago;s ActiveCampaign raises $100M for an all-in-one marketing and sales automation platform,"Marketing and sales automation ; tools that leverage the advances and data of our digital age to better identify and then interact with customers ; is big business, with the whole market expected to generate some $6.6 billion in revenues for related companies by 2025.But ;companies; is the operative word here: it;s a very fragmented space, with dozens of hopefuls covering different aspects of marketing and sales, each with its own unique approach. There is an alternative trend, though, and today a customer experience automation company called ActiveCampaign, catering not just to large enterprises but small and medium businesses too, has raised a large round of funding to build out its own one-stop-shop model. It includes the tools to run email and messaging-based marketing campaigns; marketing automation across sites and events; and sales and CRM.The Chicago-based company is today announcing that it has closed a Series B of $100 million, money that it will use to invest in building out new technology and to expand internationally. The funding is being led by Susquehanna Growth Equity,  with PE firm Silversmith Capital Partners also participating.ActiveCampaign  is not your typical startup. It has been around since 2003, and this is only the second time it has raised money ; the first time was in 2016, a modest $20 million round from Silversmith. Fundraising is not the only thing that sets it apart: it;s also profitable and has been for years (one reason it hasn;t raised money), and it;s actually already quite large, with 90,000 customers in 161 countries.Yet it;s something of a theme in the world of ;startups; ; meaning tech companies that are still privately owned and raising from VCs and related backers ; particularly those that are B2B focused, that some of the more interesting and successfully bootstrapped of them at some point turn to VC and private equity when it comes to needing an extra boost to move beyond what has become its natural growth rate.In the case of ActiveCampaign, it had a taste of what a little outside investment could do in the last few years: Jason VandeBoom, founder and CEO of ActiveCampaign, said the company has seen its annual recurring revenues grow 6x since 2016 to $90 million, with employees booming from 65 to more than 550.The company;s core proposition is that it provides a less fragmented approach to businesses interested in building in some digital marketing or sales tools into their outreach and then considering what to do next.;What we are up against are a number of companies focused on a single slice of customer experience, either CRM or a customer success platform,; VandeBoom said. ;We’re still at this point in the industry where the category is taking shape,; which spells a ripe opportunity for ActiveCampaign.The need for what ActiveCampaign provides is a basic one: Whether you are an online retailer or any business that wants to expand its audience or make sure to stay connected to the one you already have, you need tools to reach users, figure out what they want to see from you and connect in a relevant way.VandeBoom added while there are no specific plans for acquisitions that can be discussed now, the funding also gives the company ;optionality; in terms of what it might do next.Part of the company;s approach is to build technology in-house, but in the spirit of all-in-one platforms, its value also lies in how many other things its users can plug into using ActiveCampaign.The company has some 260 technology partners and a ;recipe library; with more than 250 automations already built, or users can build and customise themselves from more than 300 possible apps that can be integrated, including Shopify, Square, Facebook, Eventbrite and Salesforce.With this round, Martin Angert, director at Susquehanna, is joining ActiveCampaign’s board of directors. His existing roles on the boards of Workfront, WhiteSource, XebiaLabs and Allocadia speaks to interesting potential strategic partnerships for ActiveCampaign.“ActiveCampaign and the CXA category have grown significantly and our investment in the series B reconfirms Silversmith’s commitment to ActiveCampaign’s future,” said Todd Maclean, co-founder and managing partner of Silversmith Capital Partners, in a statement.",https://tcrn.ch/38KouoH
1937742,2020-01-28T02:00:04,Shipamax scores $7M Series A to digitise the logistics back-office,"Shipamax, the London-based startup and YC graduate that is helping freight forwarders and other logistics companies automate their back-office processes, has raised $7 million.Leading the round is Mosaic Ventures, with participation from Crane Venture Partners, Y Combinator and other existing investors. Shipamax says it will use the funding to double in size over the months ahead, investing both in engineering development and ;customer success.;Founded in 2016, Shipamax  first set out to build an online broker for bulk shipping, before pivoting to a SaaS offering for bulk shippers. However, realising that the need for digitisation was real but that the market wasn;t large enough for a ;VC scale business,; the startup pivoted one more time to develop a toolkit for back-office ;process automation; for the global logistics industry.;We;d got some traction selling the SaaS solution, but saw the market was not big enough,; Shipamax co-founder Jenna Brown tells me. ;We went back to the core of why companies were buying Shipamax and what we delivered for them. It became clear that the underlying data extraction technology we;d built was driving the core value. After speaking to a number of people in adjacent segments of logistics, we saw companies there have the exact same problem ; so it was clear we should really narrow the proposition down and widen out the segments we serve to the entire logistics market.;The core Shipamax technology connects to any email inbox or unstructured data source and automatically extracts data from emails and attachments in real time. It then outputs a clean, structured feed via the Shipamax API.The startup says that;s very different to how logistics companies have previously tried to solve the digitisation problem, typically via optical character recognition (OCR) tools such as Abbyy. ;The problem with OCR technology is that each company has to start from scratch ; setting up hundreds of ‘templates’ to capture important fields and implementing ‘rules’ to interpret this data,; says Shipamax.By using machine-learning, the company says there is no need to create templates or define rules within each organisation. Instead, Shipamax’s technology provides the ;contextual understanding; layer.Meanwhile, if you are wondering what product-market-fit looks like, once you actually find it, Shipamax says that in its current incarnation it has seen zero customer churn.The company now processes more than 18 million emails and documents per year, and says that performance is tracked by document type ; such as orders, bills of lading, supplier invoices etc., with accuracy reaching 99% for the most advanced types.;We then started to adapt the product for the new market, the large players and strong references from ;in bulk; [shipping] gave us credibility with the freight forwarding community to get access to their data to re-train some of the models,; explains Brown.;Within a few months we;d proven that we could adapt this core tech quickly to the new training sets. A few months after launching this segment, it comprised over 20% of our revenues and it;s been the fastest growing part of our business. We;re lucky that the core infrastructure we;d built for the initial market was built to handle extremely high volumes, which has made it easy to ramp up with large customers.;",https://tcrn.ch/36wHoOn

The startup said it is also rebranding its online coding program, earlier called InterviewBit Academy, to Scaler Academy. Two people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that the financing round valued InterviewBit between $100 million and $110 million.InterviewBit pivoted nine months ago to operate on an income-sharing model, where students have the option to pay much of the coaching fee after they have landed a job. The concept, also known as human capital contract, has been around for decades, but is beginning to see some traction now.The startup said more than 2,000 students have enrolled in its six-month program to date, where it runs live-streamed sessions to coach aspiring software engineers for competitive job interviews in their industry. It has so far run seven batches, one of which is being conducted in the U.S.At stake is the future of millions of students who graduate each year in India, but are massively unprepared to secure a good job. A recent study by Aspiring Minds found that the employability of Indian engineers continues to be as low as 20%. ;With that in mind, Scaler Academy’s meticulously structured six-month online program effectively enhances the coding skills of professionals by creating a modern curriculum with exposure to the latest technologies,; the startup said.. @interview_bit (Surge 01 2019) has enrolled &gt;2K students since they pivoted to an online academy in April last year.

The company operates an e-commerce website for DIY, home improvement and gardening products. This time, ManoMano  is raising $139 million (€125 million), with Temasek leading the round.General Atlantic, Eurazeo, Piton Capital, Bpifrance and Kismet Holdings are also participating. The company announced another significant funding round back in April 2019. At the time, ManoMano raised $125 million (€110 million). Overall, ManoMano has raised $344 million (€310 million) over the past six years.In 2019 alone, the company grew by 50%, with $666 million (€600 million) in gross merchandise value. While the company is still mostly active in France, its other markets (Spain, Italy, Germany and the U.K.) now represent a third of sales figures.ManoMano is betting on three pillars to differentiate its e-commerce platform from other, more generalist platforms. First, the company works directly with third-party retailers and takes care of logistics as part of the Mano Fulfillment service. Given that the marketplace focuses on a niche, ManoMano could beat competitors that also have a fulfillment service.Second, ManoMano has built a community of experts and enthusiasts to recreate the experience you’d get when you go to a store. At any time, you can start a conversation with Manodvisors. In 2019, customers had 1 million conversations with Manodvisors. Anybody can become a certified expert and get some revenue from the startup.Third, ManoMano wants to expand beyond hobbyists with ManoMano Pro. While this service is just getting started, it already represents 10% of the company’s sales in France. Obviously, professionals could lead to a higher average basket size.With today’s funding round, the company plans to recruit 200 people in Barcelona and Bordeaux.ManoMano raises $125 million for its home improvement e-commerce platform",https://tcrn.ch/2O5bTVr
1937976,2020-01-27T17:52:14,H1 Insights is giving the healthcare industry the ultimate professional database,";I want to build a business which profiles every single researcher and healthcare professional in the world and I want to sell it to industry,; says Ariel Katz, the co-founder and chief executive of H1 Insights. With the healthcare industry on a mission to digitize and analyze every conceivable data point it can to wring more efficiencies out of its incredibly fragmented and broken system, for Katz, there;s no opportunity that seems more obvious than giving the industry data on its own professionals.The idea may sound like nothing more than creating a LinkedIn  for healthcare professionals, but building an accurate account of the professional ecosystem could be a huge help to businesses as diverse as pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, insurers and, eventually, consumers.For Katz, it;s the continuation of a longstanding mission to create transparency for data sets that were previously opaque. Katz sold his first company, Research Connection (which became LabSpot), three years ago. That company was designed to uncover the research underway at universities around the country so students could see where they should apply for undergraduate and graduate studies.After the sale, the young entrepreneur went on a vacation to India, and it was there that he met his co-founder Ian Sax. ;He backpacked there to follow his wife who was volunteering with Mother Theresa [and] ended up starting a staffing company.;The two men became friends and collaborated on projects ; including software that would help medical school students find jobs.Conversations between the two soon hit upon the lack of transparency around what research was happening at which universities and which clinical trials were underway at which hospitals. A visible network of experts, the two men thought, would go a long way toward solving a number of the healthcare industry;s seemingly intractable problems.;Pharma, biotech and medical devices spend $30 billion per year partnering with researchers and hospitals,; says Katz. ;If you could allow a user sitting on the pharmaceutical side to sort and search and rank and analyze researchers; it would help reduce the cost and solve the problem.;While Katz says the transparency can help solve a number of healthcare;s drug development and discovery problems, he;s wary about creating others. H1 Insights has built certain rules on how its database should be used, which Katz hopes will limit abuse.;We don;t sell to sales and marketing arms at pharmaceutical companies,; he says. The risk there is that these sales and marketing arms could put undue pressure on doctors to skew research.The data that H1 collects is already public, so there;s no need for the company to use user-generated data to build out its data set. ;It;s all public. The biggest problem is de-duping it,; says Katz.The company already has 350,000 academic researchers and 4 million healthcare professionals in its database already.That body of knowledge was enough to attract Y Combinator,  which accepted H1 Insight into its latest cohort of companies.With the accelerator;s help, H1 Insights wants to take its business global and develop applications for the pharmaceutical industry, care providers and ultimately consumers.The initial application for all of that data is clinical trials.;The number one reason why clinical trials fail is recruitment,; says Katz. ;If you can find a principal investigator who has done a successful clinical trial in an adjacent space,; pharma companies can improve their chances for success, according to Katz. ",https://tcrn.ch/36wXSGj
1937991,2020-01-27T14:58:01,NASA taps startup Axiom Space for the first habitable commercial module for the Space Station,"NASA  has selected Houston-based Axiom Space, a startup founded in 2016, to build the first commercial habitat module for the International Space Station (ISS). This module will be used as a destination for future commercial spaceflight missions, potentially housing experiments, technology development and more performed by commercial space travelers taking rides up to the ISS via human-rated spacecraft like the SpaceX Crew Dragon and Boeing Starliner, once those start regular operational service.Axiom Space was founded in 2016, and is led by co-founder and CEO Michael T. Suffredini, who previously acted as program manager for the ISS at NASA;s Johnson Space Center. The company boasts a lot of ex-NASA talent on its small team, and eventually it plans to make its in-space modules the basis of its own private space station, after first attaching them to the ISS while it;s still operating. NASA has extended the planned service life of the ISS, but the plan of the agency;s current leadership is to eventually encourage private orbital labs and commercial facilities as an ultimate replacement.In 2018, Axiom teamed up with designer Philippe Starck  (yes, the same one who famously designed a luxury yacht for Apple  founder Steve Jobs) to provide a look at what their future space station modules might look like, including crew quarters with interactive displays and a cupola that provides a breathtaking view of Earth and surrounding space.This ISS module may not be a full-fledged private space station, but it is a step in NASA;s goal of further commercializing the existing space station and ultimately paving the way for more commercial activity in low Earth orbit. Axiom;s mandate also includes providing ;at least one habitable commercial module,; with the implication being that it might be awarded extensions to build more in the future. Next up for the new partners is negotiating terms and price for a contract for the module, which will also include a timeline for delivery.",https://tcrn.ch/2U53rsT
1937967,2020-01-27T13:59:49,"With $5 million from international backers, Mexico;s Moons brings its Invisalign killer to YC","Moons, a Mexico City-based startup that;s angling to be the Invisalign for the Latin American market, has joined the ranks of Y Combinator as part of the accelerator;s latest cohort.The company already has $5 million in financing in the bank from an international group of investors, including Jaguar Ventures, Foundation Capital and Tuesday Capital, along with a whole host of strategic individual investors from Latin America;s dental community.;We provide dental services throughout Mexico, Colombia and soon throughout Latin America,; says Moon co-founder and chief executive officer, Tommaso Tomba.Like Invisalign, Moons conducts free initial conversations with potential patients and does a free scan of their teeth. ;We have a team of orthodontists that take a look at the patient and determines whether the patient is a good candidate,; says Tomba.If there;s a good fit, then the company creates a treatment plan and consultation schedule with a patient and fits them out with a pair of 3D-printed aligners ; all for around $1,200.That;s far lower than the treatment costs using established vendors, says Tomba. Already the company has 18 locations in Mexico and another two in Colombia ; where Tomba expects operations to expand at a rapid clip. ;We;re turning more cases than Invisalign in Mexico because we;ve brought the price right down,; says Tomba.A graduate of Cambridge and Oxford Universities, Tomba and his founding team chose Latin America to launch their dental business after months of market analysis. Latin America is host to three of the most active destinations for cosmetic surgeries in the world.Tomba market-tested by creating a website advertising the launch of his new business and taking pre-orders for the service in Europe, Latin America and the U.S. He settled on Mexico in part because of the demand he saw and in part because he;d had experience in the market previously as an early employee of Linio ; a Rocket Internet-backed competitor to Amazon on the continent.During his time at Linio, Tomba met his co-founder Leonardo Miron, a serial entrepreneur whose previous business was a mobile phone repair service called Rescata. Alex Clapp, a university friend of Tomba;s with experience in investment banking and healthcare-focused private equity in London and New York, rounded out the founding team.The team chose to apply to Y Combinator because of the firm;s access to capital and ability to open doors in the U.S., Tomba said. ;In LatAm, access to capital to build long-lasting companies is still relatively limited compared to the U.S., so we think it makes sense to YC so that they help us with investors and attracting talent going forward,; he said.And Moons has bigger dreams than just the dental market. ;We plan to go into other healthcare verticals,; says Tomba. ;Always with the core tenet of providing high-quality healthcare and making it accessible.;",https://tcrn.ch/2TZsvl6
1933179,2020-01-27T13:28:10,Diet autopilot Thistle raises $5M for health food subscriptions,"What if it was easier to eat salad than junk food? Most diet routines take a ton of time, whether you;re cooking from scratch, making a meal kit or seeking a nutritious restaurant. But on-demand prepared food delivery companies like Sprig that tried to eliminate that work have gone bankrupt from poor unit economics.Thistle is a different type of food startup. It delivers thrice-weekly cooler bags customized with meat-optional, plant-based breakfasts, lunches, dinners, snacks, sides and juices. By batching deliveries in the less-congested early morning hours and optimizing routes to its subscribers, or by mailing weekly boxes beyond its own geographies, Thistle  makes sure you already have your food the moment you;re hungry. Whether you heat them up or eat them straight out of the fridge, you;re actually dining faster than you could even place an Uber Eats order.The food on Thistle;s constantly rotating menu is downright tasty. You might get a sunrise chia parfait for breakfast, a chicken tropical mango salad for lunch, a microwaveable bulgogi noodle bowl for dinner, with beet hummus and kale-cucumber juice for snacks. Thistle;s not cheap, with meals averaging about $14 each. But compared to competitors; on-demand delivery markups and service fees, wasting ingredients from the grocer and the hours of cooking for yourself, it can be a good deal for busy people.;We see Thistle as part of a movement to make health convenient rather than a high willpower chore,; CEO Ashwin Cheriyan tells me. What Peloton did to shave time off getting a great workout, Thistle does for eating a nourishing meal. It makes the right choice the easiest choice.Thistle COO Shiri Avnery and CEO Ashwin Cheriyan with their daughterThe idea of a button you can push to make you healthier has attracted a new $5.65 million Series A round for Thistle led by its first institutional investor, PowerPlant Ventures . Bringing the startup to $15 million in funding, the cash will expand Thistle;s delivery domain. Dan Gluck of PowerPlant, which has also funded food break-outs like Beyond Meat, Thrive Market and Rebbl, will join the board.Currently Thistle delivers in-person to the Bay Area, LA metro, San Diego and Sacramento while shipping to most of Washington, Oregon, Utah, Idaho, Nevada and Arizona. Thistle actually held off on raising more since launching in 2013 to make sure it hammered out unit economics to prevent an implosion. It;s also planning broader meal options, additional product lines and fresh distribution strategies like getting stocked in office smart kitchens or subsidized by wellness plans.;The reasons that so many food delivery companies have failed likely fall into two buckets: one, a lack of focus on margins and unit economics, and two, premature geographic expansion before proving out the business model,; says Cheriyan. ;Thistle makes money similar to how a well-run restaurant would make money ; by having strong gross margins, efficient customer acquisition costs and solid customer retention / lifetime metrics. We currently deliver tens of thousands of meals on a weekly basis to customers on the West Coast and our annual average growth rate since launch has been 100%+.;It;s nice that Thistle hasn;t gone out of business, because I;ve been eating its salads 6X a week for three years. It;s been the most efficient way for me to get healthier and lose weight after a half-decade of ordering takeout sandwiches and then feeling sluggish all day. I legitimately look forward to each one since they often have 20+ ingredients and only repeat every few months, so they;re never boring.It has helped me keep my work-from-home lunches to about 20 minutes so I have more time for writing. Thistle is one of the few startups I consistently recommend to people. When asked how I lost 25lbs before my wedding, I point to Peloton cycling, Future remote personal training and Thistle salads ; none of which require me to leave the house.Cheriyan tells me, ;We wanted the better-for-you and better-for-planet choice to be the default choice.;Growing out of on-demandThistle has already pivoted past the business model burning tons of cash across the startup world. The company started as an on-demand cold-pressed juice delivery service, sending hipster glass bottles of watermelon and charcoal extract to doors around San Francisco. It was 2013, yoga was booming and people were paying crazily high prices for liquified lemongrass. Health made simple seemed like a sure bet to the founding team of Alap Shah, Naman Shah, Sheel Mohnot and Johnny Hwin, some of whom run Studio Management, a family office and startup incubator. [Disclosure: Hwin and Alap Shah are friends of mine, but didn;t pitch or discuss this article with me.]Thistle eventually straightened things out with a shift to subscriptions and batched delivery under the leadership of the newly added co-founders, Cheriyan and his wife and COO Shiri Avnery. ;I came from a family of physicians ; both my parents, brother, and enough aunts, uncles, and cousins are doctors that they could start a small hospital,; Cheriyan, a former corporate attorney in M&amp;A tells me. ;A common point of frustration was about patients suffering from diet-related illnesses who were unable to make a lifestyle change because it was too hard.;Avnery, a PhD in air pollution and climate change;s impact on agriculture, had become exasperated with the slow pace of policy change and the inaction of governments and corporations. The two quit their jobs, moved to San Francisco, and searched for a point of leverage for positively influencing people;s diets and interaction with the environment. They teamed up with the founders and launched Thistle v1.A lack of experience in logistics led to the initial detour into on-demand. But rather than trying to fix the problem with VC money, Thistle stayed lean and discovered the opportunity nestled between Uber Eats and Blue Apron: sending people food they don;t have to eat now, but that takes low or no time to prepare when they;re peckish. Through its app, users can customize their meal plans, ban their allergens, pause deliveries and see what they;ll eat next.A sample of Thistle 8 meal plans;The unit economics problem most heavily plagued the early on-demand food companies. Food / labor waste and inefficient deliveries were likely the biggest reasons why the economics were unsustainable without venture life support. We know this personally as Thistle started our delivery service as an on-demand company before quickly realizing that the unit economics couldn’t sustain a healthy business,; Cheriyan explains, regarding companies like Sprig, DoorDash and Grubhub. Beyond unsold food, ;the margins very likely did not support ordering a $12-$15 single meal for immediate delivery when average hourly driver wages reached $18-20.;Meal kits were supposed to make dining healthier and cheaper, but they proved too much of a chore and led customers to boxes of ingredients piling up unused. Munchery and Nomiku went out of business while giants like Blue Apron have incinerated hundreds of millions of dollars and seen their share prices sink.;The meal kit companies fared a little better from a gross margin perspective (due to pre-orders and more efficient deliveries), but suffer most from an easy-to-copy business model. This led to a rise in copycats, and, as a result, heavily rising customer acquisition costs, low switching costs and poor retention,; Cheriyan tells me. ;Fundamentally the meal kit companies face another challenge, which is that people have less and less time to cook and are increasingly looking for ready-to-eat options.;Push-button healthA slower, steadier approach with less overhead, more convenience and fewer direct competitors has helped Thistle grow to 400 employees, from culinary to engineering to logistics.Still, it;s vulnerable. It may still be too expensive for some markets and demographics. Logistics experts like Amazon and Whole Foods could try to barge into the market. Cloud kitchens without dining rooms are making restaurant food more affordable for delivery. And another startup could always take the gamble on raising a ton of cash and subsidizing prices to steal market share, especially where Thistle doesn;t operate yet.Thistle could counter these threats by further eliminating delivery costs by selling through partners like office smart fridges where employees pay on the spot, or equipping gym lobbies with more than just Muscle Milk.;One opportunity we’re excited to test is attended and unattended retail ; it would be great to be able to pick up Thistle products at your local grocery store, gym or coffee shop,; Cheriyan says. As for offices, ;Today’s corporate lunchtime solutions often require a trade-off between health and convenience: either wait in line for 30+ minutes at your favorite salad spot for a healthy option, or opt into catered restaurant meals that leave you feeling sluggish and unproductive.; Thistle could help employers prevent the 3pm energy lull.The startup;s focus on plant-forward meals also centers it in the path of another megatrend: the shift to environmentally conscious diets. Almost 60% of Americans are trying to eat less meat and 50% are eating meat-alternatives like Impossible Burgers. That stems both from interest in the humane treatment of animals and how 15% of green house emissions come from livestock. But 45% of Americans say they hate to cook. That;s why Thistle makes pre-made meals where meat and egg are optional, but the food is healthy and delicious without them.In the age of Uber, we;ve acclimated to an effortless life. The new wave of ;push-button health; startups like Thistle could finally take the hassle out of aligning your actions in the gym or kitchen with your intentions.",https://tcrn.ch/3aQ5jvt

Others participating in the round include existing investors Mayfair Equity, Hoxton Ventures and Ibis, along with other angels.To date, SuperAwesome  has raised $37 million in outside investment.SuperAwesome has been tapping into the need for more kid-friendly technology on the web that;s now used just as much by younger children as it is by adults.;Historically the internet was designed to be used by adults, but now over 40% of new users are kids,; said SuperAwesome CEO Dylan Collins. ;We’re in the middle of a structural shift in the composition of the internet that requires investment in privacy and kidtech to support children. This is as big a transition as mobile was for the desktop internet,; he noted.The company;s platform includes products for kid-safe advertising, social engagement tools, authentication and parental controls. The breadth of this lineup has attracted big-name kids; brands as customers, including Activision, Hasbro, Mattel, Lego, Cartoon Network, Spin Master, Nintendo, Bandai, WB, Shopkins maker Moose Toys, WPP, Omnicom, Dentsu, Niantic and Wildworks, among others.Today, the company has more than 300 customers in total.SuperAwesome;s technology has arrived at a critical time for many working in the kids; app space, as governments are newly enacting and enforcing a range of kids; privacy laws like COPPA (the U.S. Children;s Online Privacy Protection Rule) and GDPR-K in the E.U., as well as other laws in major markets like China, Brazil and India. In the U.S., for example, the FTC has slapped apps like Musical.ly (now TikTok) and YouTube with record fines for violations of children;s privacy regulations.These changes have been a boon to SuperAwesome, which is now fully profitable and powering more than 12 billion kids; digital transactions per month. Last year, the company pulled in $55 million in revenue and is on track for $80 to $90 million in revenue in 2020, Collins told TechCrunch.SuperAwesome and Microsoft aren;t yet talking in detail about how the two companies will be teaming up, following the strategic investment. One thing being discussed by the two, however, are the opportunities around family identity, we;re told. In addition, Microsoft today is focused on both privacy and kids across its products ; for example, with its web browser as well as with its educational efforts involving Minecraft, among other things.;After we spent time with the M12  team and folks in Microsoft, it was clear we shared the same vision of where the internet is going: more kids and more privacy,; Collins said.;We are proud to welcome the SuperAwesome team to the M12 portfolio. Dylan has cultivated a mission-driven team dedicated to keeping the internet safer for kids—a critical priority for digital-first generations,; said Nagraj Kashyap, Microsoft corporate vice president and global head of M12, in a statement about the funding. ;Given Microsoft’s footprint in the identity management space, we’re excited to explore opportunities for partnership with SuperAwesome as well,; Kashyap added.",https://tcrn.ch/37v04PO

Bird,  the LA-founded e-scooter giant, has confirmed that it is acquiring European competitor Circ, the micromobility company founded by Lukasz Gadowski of Delivery Hero fame.The deal, for which terms remain undisclosed, was first reported by FT late last week. Meanwhile, TechCrunch revealed in late November that Circ was facing difficulties and had issued a round of layoffs following so-called ;operational learnings.;Circ, the Berlin-based e-scooter company, makes layoffs following ;operational learnings;At the time, Gadowski put on a brave face, telling TechCrunch that Circ needed to learn how to operate a micromobility service across many European markets simultaneously. “Basically figure out how to be more efficient, how to run a micromobility operation; it’s not optimized yet and we learned over the summer,; he said.He also conceded that, within the micromobility space more generally, there had been something of a land grab strategy that is now perhaps inevitably shifting toward greater emphasis on capital efficiency. “When we started this there was a focus on time to market, but now it is not about time to market but efficiency,” he told TechCrunch.We also understand Circ was in the midst of trying to raise a Series B, which is what prompted talks with Bird. Early last year, the startup closed a Series A north of $60 million, funding it used to push into 12 countries and 43 cities, a spokesperson tells us.On the funding front, Bird is also taking this announcement as an opportunity to share that they;ve added to their own funding, tacking on another $75 million onto their Series D, which now sits at $350 million.Micromobility companies have been hard-pressed to cut spending and push toward profitability. One of Bird;s chief competitors, Lime, announced earlier this month they were laying off 100 employees and leaving 12 markets with the goal of becoming profitable in 2020.Three hundred employees will be added to Bird;s European operations as a result of the deal, the company says.",https://tcrn.ch/2RvUQxJ

The funds come after Mural, formerly Mural.ly, had raised just a few million dollars previously. That fact made its round interesting: How did the company raise 10 times its prior total in one round, and why did it pursue so much money in a single shot?TechCrunch chatted with the company;s CEO, Mariano Suarez-Battan, and Weston Gaddy, the round;s lead investor hailing from Radian Capital, to better understand the investment. Endeavor Catalyst and Google;s Gradient Ventures also put money into the round.Efficient growthAround the time when WeWork;s IPO was collapsing under its own hubris, the venture market changed. In a flash, growth lost its shine, and efficient growth became the new hot thing. Mural got there a little earlier than its market, which appears to have put it in a strong position today.Asked why the company had put together a $23 million round when it did, Suarez-Battan told TechCrunch that after growing the company on the back of customer revenue, it felt in 2019 that it was time to add more capital to the bank.;We grew with our customers,; the CEO said, going back in time to explain: ;Starting in 2014, IBM became our first and biggest customer. And since then we;ve been selling to large firms, [today] most of our revenue comes from large firms.; The CEO went on to cite ;six-figure deals and a couple that are more than a million bucks a year; as evidence that his company;s approach to growth has worked.Where does the new capital come in? According to Suarez-Battan, in 2019, the company started to notice that customers wanted to buy more from it. This was evidence, he said, that the company;s ;land-and-expand motion; was working. He says that enterprise momentum was the impetus to bring in a great team to ;build a group of people that can help, interact with consultants, and go to market together.;So on the back of customer momentum and proven demand, the firm is going to staff up. That;s a pretty traditional use of venture capital, but one that, given the firm;s history of capital efficiency, seems to fit the current climate.Gaddy also answered the why now, and why so much question, saying that Mural is riding a ;secular trend in terms of how people are going to produce creative work.; He also said that the company;s user traction, product traction and revenue traction were evidence of product-market fit. Investors love product-market fit.The marketMural is a tool that can be seen as a remote-work-friendly service. It;s also workplace collaboration software, putting it smack-dab in the middle of two current trends in Startuplandia.Remote work is growing, albeit more slowly than its acolytes might have you think, while workplace collaboration tooling has seen tremendous venture interest. Recall that the hottest startup out of the last Y Combinator batch was Tandem, which calls itself a ;virtual office for remote teams,; making another company that helps remote staffs and others collaborate.We haven;t heard much from, or about, Tandem lately, but Mural is certainly now richer than it ever has been.

You also can upload photos alongside the recording.Since launch, Otter has expanded its product to millions of users and now offers both an Otter for Teams and enterprise tier. With the new NTT DOCOMO partnership, the goal is to bring the Otter enterprise collaboration services to the Japanese market, explains Liang, the former Google architect who later sold his location startup Alohar Mobile to Alibaba.;DOCOMO and other large companies have a large international workforce who communicate in English for their international conference calls,; says Liang. ;They will use Otter to take automatic meeting notes, and improve meeting and communication effectiveness; The goal is to further enhance communication and collaboration on top of Otter;s automatic English meeting note services,; he adds.Otter.ai  has similar partnerships with U.S. businesses, including Zoom Video Communications and Dropbox.As a result of the new partnership, Otter;s Voice Meeting Notes application is being used on a trial basis in Berlitz Corporation’s English language classes in Japan. Students are using Otter to transcribe and review their lessons, click on sections of text and initiate voice playback. DOCOMO, Otter.ai and Berlitz are also expanding their collaboration in language education to verify Otter’s effectiveness in the study of English, the company says.;The Japanese market values high-quality detailed meeting notes, and Otter;s highly accurate A.I.-powered note-taker overcomes language barriers and improves the operating efficiency of Japanese companies with global operations,; said Tomoyoshi Oono, senior vice president and general manager of the Innovation Management Department in the R&amp;D Innovation Division at DOCOMO, in a statement about the deal. ;There is a large business market opportunity for Otter.ai and DOCOMO’s translation service.;DOCOMO is also featuring Otter during demonstrations at DOCOMO Open House 2020 taking place in the Tokyo Big Sight exhibition complex January 23 and 24, 2020. Here, Otter will transcribe the English-language presentations in real time, which will then be translated into Japanese using DOCOMO;s machine translation technology. Both the English transcription and Japanese translation will be projected on a large screen for attendees to read.While Otter;s transcriptions aren;t perfect in real-world scenarios, like where there;s background noise or muffled speaking, it does better when it can be connected directly to the audio source, like at big events. (TechCrunch, for example, has used Otter;s service to transcribe audio at TechCrunch Disrupt.)Otter;s new funding will also used to hire more engineers and further enhance its AI technologies in speech recognition, diarization, speaker identification and automatic summarization, Liang tells TechCrunch. And the team will work to accelerate Otter;s adoption by enterprise customers in professional services, media and education.",https://tcrn.ch/313NmoP

The round also includes Joyance Partners, a New York-based VC concentrating on the new science emerging around ;health and happiness; which recently expanded to the U.K. and Europe.The funding will be used to manufacture WholyMe’s  first range of 100% organic supplements and topicals for muscle and joint health, starting with a cannabis-based ointment slated to launch in spring 2020. Formulated in-house and manufactured in Europe, WholyMe products will be sold online; the startup also has plans to partner with gym clubs to support athletic millennials by preventing injuries.Its direct competitors include natural health brands like Tiger Balm, BetterYou and Weleda, but also adjacent competitors such as Voltarol and Deep Heat.They say their differentiating factors are that, at the product level, their products ;have no adverse effects as opposed to conventional pain killers,” while they say the ingredients are organic and contain no synthetics, petroleum, GMOs etc.The market they are aiming at is certainly large. The natural medicine products market is now worth €16 billion in Europe and has grown +7% CAGR from 2017-2023, according to the latest figures.Co-founders Celine Ivari and Quitterie de Rivoyre researched and developed WholyMe’s first products while trying to solve chronic inflammation problems plaguing family members.Ivari says: “When my mother suffered from severe inflammation, she was overloaded with painkillers and prescription drugs, which had terrible side effects. Having studied the genetics of human disease, I knew there were alternative solutions to manage her pain. I helped her improve her well-being through natural remedies.”Paolo Pio, European managing director for Joyance Partners, said in a statement: “We’re thrilled to support WholyMe as they push the boundaries of health &amp; pain management to bring greater happiness to the world.”",https://tcrn.ch/2GoowXc

Regular Equity episodes still drop Friday morning, so if you’ve listened to the show over the years, don’t worry — we’re not changing it in the slightest. (Here’s last week’s episode, which took a look at The Athletic;s latest round, in case you missed it.)This Monday was a bit of a bad news run. The weekend was stuffed with news, not much of it good.Continued concerns relating to the spread of the coronavirus led to equity selloffs in Asia and Europe. In the United States, markets look set to follow suit. The concerns come as startups had already come under pressure from investors to show a quick path to profitability. Now, their public comps are taking fire as well.Topping it off, today kicks off a huge, two-week earnings run from tech companies worth trillions of dollars. It;s not a great moment for it. (As we note on the show, the economic side of the outbreak is a small portion of the story; it feels a bit crass to cover the moment from a dollars-perspective, but that;s our particular lens.)We also ran through three funding rounds, including Mural;s $23 million Series A, Otter.ai;s $10 million Series B and Sawee;s $2.3 million round focused on last-mile logistics. (As a product, I can;t recommend Otter highly enough.)Wrapping, a Wall Street Journal story was stuck in my head all weekend. According to the Journal;s Eliot Brown, Lime and DoorDash have each been out in the markets trying to raise money lately. Neither has managed to pull it off.

1937650,2020-01-27T05:05:37,Teller raises $4M to take on Plaid in the US by providing API access to bank accounts,";They;re idiots, they;re really naive,; is how Stevie Graham, the co-founder of fintech Teller, once described Open Banking Limited, the body charged with delivering open banking in the U.K.His view back in 2017 ; which now looks somewhat prophetic ; was that open banking wouldn;t be the competition driver it was hyped up to be. Instead, incumbent banks were incapable of change and would act in a malevolent way to stop fintechs from walking through the front door and stealing their lunch.He, along with co-founder Dan Palmer, had spent several years building an early version of Teller  that reverse-engineered the APIs  used by U.K. banks for their own mobile apps, and offered access to developers that wanted to create apps using banking data. It was billed as a more robust and real-time alternative to either screenscraping or waiting haplessly for PSD2 ; the European directive mandating open banking ; to eventually come into existence.But this inevitably meant playing a game of Whac-A-Mole as incumbent U.K. banks tried unsuccessfully to thwart the efforts of Graham and Palmer. It was also never entirely clear who was doing the whacking.Fast-forward to today, and Graham, who was Twillio;s first European employee, has a different incumbent in his sights. In late 2018, Teller re-incorporated in the U.S. to take on Plaid,  the financial services API provider recently acquired by Visa for a chunky $5.3 billion.The fintech startup also quietly raised $4 million in seed capital from a slew of U.S. investors: Lightspeed Venture Partners,  Founders Fund  and PayPal  co-founder Max Levchin’s SciFi. Teller;s U.K. product has since been shut down, and the company launched a U.S. beta of Teller in September.;The U.S. is a better opportunity for Teller because the market is far larger with more mature, large-scale customers to serve as well as startups being created every day, [and] an incumbent with an unreliable, unpopular product and not much competition,; Graham tells me.;PSD2 was also a factor in our decision to withdraw from the U.K. Primarily because it made practically every use-case of banking APIs  a regulated activity, meaning that it’s no longer possible to quickly build and test a product without first spending thousands of pounds and 3-6 months getting FCA approval. When we checked at the end of 2018, less than 100 entities had been granted approval. We can not build the business we want with a total addressable market of 100 customers.;On Plaid,  Graham is almost as scathing as he was about the major U.K. banks three years ago, even if he chooses his words a little more carefully. Unlike Plaid, Teller;s technology is not built using screenscraping, dubbed a ;creaky technique; by the Teller co-founder, and therefore is ;more reliable and performant.;;We are also better because we have the incentive to really care about our users and mean it. Plaid has rolled up the market by buying Quovo and is now effectively a monopoly. Speaking to users we found a lot of frustrated Plaid customers that didn’t feel as if Plaid was sympathetic when things went wrong. For example their Capital One integration has been down for months. Maybe the Plaid folks genuinely can’t fix it, maybe they don’t have truly enough competition to care. Either way, our Capital One integration works great.;Suspicious of Visa;s  ability to innovate and serve developers as customers, Graham says that if he was a Plaid user he would be concerned about the future quality of the product now that it;s owned by a legacy business ;not exactly renowned for ; shipping successful developer products.;The deal is also substantially all-cash, he notes, suggesting that employees may have little incentive to stay.;The top talent at Plaid has to now be sitting there in the morning thinking ;do I really want to work at a stodgy public company that has barely 3x;d its stock price in five years? This is not what I signed up for.; This is why I fear for the future of Plaid’s product. A lot of their best people will be heading for the door, and we’d love to talk to them,; Graham says unabashedly.",https://tcrn.ch/30VNI0G

In 2019 alone, N26  managed to add more than 2.5 million customers. And the company’s growth rate seems to be accelerating, as N26 reached 3.5 million customers in June 2019.That represents an addition of 1 million customers during the first half of 2019 and an addition of 1.5 million customers during the second half of 2019.One reason N26 is growing at a faster pace is that the company is still expanding to new markets. N26 has been available all around the Eurozone for a while. People living in the U.K., Denmark, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Liechtenstein, Iceland and Switzerland can also open an N26 account.But N26 also expanded to the U.S. during the summer of 2019. It represents a huge market opportunity, even though N26 faces competition from local players, such as Chime.Over the past five months, N26 has managed to attract 250,000 customers in the U.S. The company operates under a sligthly different model in the U.S. N26 has partnered with Axos Bank, a white-label partner that manages your money, while N26 takes care of all the interactions between customers and their money.Banking regulation is complicated in the U.S., which makes it difficult to launch a challenger bank across all 50 states without a banking partner.There are now 1,500 people working for N26 across five offices — Berlin, New York, Barcelona, Vienna and São Paulo.

Existing investors B Capital, Accel, Chiratae Ventures and IFC also participated in the round, the startup said.Mumbai-based Bizongo has raised about $56 million to date. It was valued at about $96 million in its Series B financing round in 2018, according to an analysis of its regulatory filings.The five-year-old startup serves as a marketplace for businesses to identify, buy and sell material packing solutions across industries. It also offers in-house packing design, development and procurement solutions.Sachin Agarwal, chief operating officer and co-founder of Bizongo, said the startup offers a unique value proposition of promising a “100% availability of packaging material and no-stock-outs at very low inventory.”“This helps clients to reduce their packaging material procurement cost by 2-5% and at the same time ensures better production planning for our supply partners. This creates a strong value proposition for all stakeholders across the value chain,” he said in a statement.Bizongo did not reveal how many customers it has, but said they span some of the nation’s leading e-commerce, retail and FMCD industries. On its website, it mentions that it works with more than 750 manufacturers in India, and has delivered 290 million packaging units to date. It also claims to have served over 350 brands.In a statement, Aniket Deb, chief executive and co-founder of Bizongo, said the startup has witnessed a “significant improvement in operating metrics since the last round of financing and the current round will further help us grow the business in a sustainable way.”The fresh fund will be deployed to ramp up technology infrastructure and to expand to newer sectors such as pharma packaging. Deb said the startup also plans to work on expanding its presence in the country.“We believe in the vision of the founders who are transforming and digitising the highly fragmented B2B packaging marketplace by leveraging technology and a unique supply chain efficiency solution. Bizongo has demonstrated strong momentum by continuing to add marquee clients and we have been impressed with the company’s rapid growth trajectory over the past year,” said Kabir Narang, general partner at B Capital Group,  in a statement.",https://tcrn.ch/38SQLK3
1937587,2020-01-26T16:04:44,"Currencycloud nabs $80M from Visa, World Bank Group and more for cross-border payment APIs","Sending money from one country to another ; either because you are a business paying someone for a service, or a family member working abroad and sending money back home, or something in between ; is a huge business, worth some $700 million annually. Today, a London startup called Currencycloud, which has built a set of remittance APIs that let any financial business integrate money transfer services into its platform, is announcing that it has raised $80 million to tap into that opportunity, and to help take on the Western Unions of the world.To date, more than $50 billion has been transferred between some 180 countries using Currencycloud;s  85 APIs, which cover areas like inbound money collection (helping clients get paid), foreign exchange, outgoing payments, digital wallet services managing multiple currencies and more.Mike Laven, Currencycloud;s American CEO (but not the founder: those are Nigel Verdon, Steve Lemon, Rich Arundel, Dave Mason and Nick Bourner), tells TechCrunch that the company has some 350 companies using its APIs as of the end of 2019, and it employs 230 people, but you are almost certainly never going to see it, even if you;ve used it.;No one is doing what we’re doing in terms of the model we have,; Laven said, referring to what he describes as an ;embedded model; where transfer is seamlessly embedded into its customers; platform and workflow. ;I’m not competing with our customers. My brand is invisible. We think we’re still the only one that has that kind of solution.;This round, a Series E, has a number of heavy hitters among the startup;s new strategic investors. They include Visa, the World Bank Group;s International Finance Corporation, French bank BNP Paribas, the SBI Group (the Japanese giant that was once a part, but now independent, of SoftBank) and Thailand;s Siam Commercial Bank. With that, Laven said that Asia will be a big focus for Currencycloud in the year ahead, with a new office in Singapore to tap into providing money-transfer APIs to businesses in the region.At least one of its newest investors, Visa, is also integrating Currencycloud;s services into its own. Existing investors Sapphire Ventures, Notion Capital, GV (formerly known as Google Ventures, which led its Series D), Accomplice and Anthemis are also participating.As for the valuation, Laven said it was not being disclosed ; not the focus for the company at the moment, building is ; but he confirmed that the pre-money amount was higher than when it previously raised. Reliable sources have confirmed to us that it;s actually around the half-billion dollar mark.This is a huge leap for the company. For some context, we first reported the news that Currencycloud was raising last summer, and at the time, when it had closed about $40 million of the funding, PitchBook estimated the pre-money valuation at $114 million and post-money at $184 million. That would imply that this Series E puts the London-based startup;s valuation at around $220 million (and took somewhat longer to close than originally planned), although it has had a much bigger leap, it seems, in part because of its growth. To date, Currencycloud has raised $140 million.The startup has been around since 2012 and was early to identify the opportunity in the money-transfer market.The trend of globalisation in the world economy has led to a sharp rise in the pace of remittances, helped by the expansion of the internet and smartphone usage ; which has spelled opportunity for companies leveraging the latter to enter the market. And in terms of the companies providing money-transfer services, while there are some notable legacy names like Western Union and MoneyGram, by and large it;s a fragmented market ; leaving an opportunity for many more hopefuls to get involved.But on top of all that, the system is largely expensive and inefficient ; meaning there was a lucrative opportunity for a company to come along and provide an easy way to plug into the rails ; say, by way of APIs ; to build these services (not unlike what companies like Adyen or Stripe have done for e-commerce payments).All roads, effectively, led to Currencycloud, and it;s seen business expand. To date, Currencycloud says that it has processed more than $50 billion in cross-border payments, with the proliferation of so-called neobanks (or challenger banks, going head-to-head with traditional institutions in the business of deposits and lending using all-digital, mobile-first platforms) helping it along. Customers include Monzo, Moneze, Starling, Revolut and Dwolla ; alongside the likes of bigger players like Visa now also getting involved.“I’m delighted to be joining the board of such an exciting technology company,” added Colleen Ostrowski, SVP and treasurer at Visa, in a statement. “Currencycloud is re-shaping the way that the platforms of the future are moving money around the world, and there is huge potential for the company to drive further innovation in the cross-border payments industry.” Updated with more detail on valuation.",https://tcrn.ch/2uBLV4I
1937460,2020-01-25T09:02:26,Startups Weekly: Tech layoffs spread (a bit),"Are January layoffs just a few post-WeWork jitters?TechCrunch  has found itself writing about layoffs at a few notable tech companies this week — and not just SoftBank-backed ones. The focus is very much profits, as Alex Wilhelm summed up on Thursday, especially after the failed WeWork  IPO and subsequent valuation and headcount decimation. We;ll soon be digging into the topic more, but there does seem to be a certain consumery thread here. And perhaps some fears of negative macro trends bubbling up?23andMe cut 16%, or 100 people, citing slowing sales for DNA tests. Quora reduced an undisclosed number to focus on revenue. Plenty of tech investors have criticized SoftBank;s  approach to writing large checks for large valuations, but they can;t avoid the same fears these days. So does Mozilla, which had to cut 70 people this month after struggling to build revenue products.It still all seems sort of normal, given the very high valuations and recent reconsiderations, at least so far. Layoffs may very well continue this year in a way that is necessary and even healthy in the long run.More on TechCrunch, from Alex:23andMe  and Mozilla are not alone, however. Playful Studios cut staff just this week, 2019 itself saw more than 300% more tech layoffs than in the preceding year and TechCrunch has covered a litany of layoffs at Vision Fund-backed companies over the past few months, including:Staff cuts at Zume, the startup famous for considering making mobile pizza robotsPersonnel reductions at Rappi, an e-commerce companyCuts at Getaround, a car rental serviceLayoffs at Oyo, a budget hotel unicornScooter unicorns Lime and Bird have also reduced staff this year. The for-profit drive is firing on all cylinders in the wake of the failed WeWork IPO attempt. WeWork was an  outlier in terms of how bad its financial results were, but the fear it introduced to the market appears pretty damn mainstream by this point. (Forsake hope, alle ye whoe require a Series H.)Image: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch2019 venture data had soft spots, maybeFresh data sets are in on last year from Crunchbase,  as well as PitchBook and the NVCA. Alex identified a few key takeaways: slightly lower early-stage fundings, a big global year overall and some of the above WeWork-attributed drops already surfacing in the Q4 data over on TechCrunch.I have to wonder what we really know right now, though. These are the best publicly accessible funding databases out there, but many companies have stopped filing Form Ds with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  in recent years, as Danny Crichton has been covering in this ongoing series. That was a main data source, especially about early-stage stealth companies.The Crunchbase report goes over the global trend for the year, and that;s another confounding factor, actually — how trackable are startup funding dollars across borders these days? And how do you account for remote teams in that mix? And how do you account for crypto;?If you are building a company now at any stage, the financial signs out now are not, in my humble opinion, ones to have any fear over. Especially relative to the other problems that are almost certainly in front of you.There is a lot of money in VC now regardless of anything else, as the PitchBook-NVCA report notes, and there will be for a long time.How to handle a recessionAs if on cue, we had a couple guest columnists provide articles about capital efficiency and recession-proofing your company. Shin Kim has a two-parter on TechCrunch and Extra Crunch, where he breaks down why most tech IPOs are not WeWork (in a good way) and how to pace your own fundraising regardless of anything else going on. Schwark Satyavolu, meanwhile, digs into the best practices for startups in the next recession (Extra Crunch membership required), starting with this brutal real-life intro:I founded my first startup, Yodlee, in a strong economy with almost 20 competitors. Ten years and a painful recession later, we were the only game in town. Critical to our success was acquiring our largest competitor, something we never could have done in a strong economy because they never would have been willing to sell. The recession made it untenable for them to fundraise, enabling us not only to buy them, but to do so without cash in an all-equity deal.A proclamation about board diversityBoard representation is a hot topic for companies of all sizes, and none other than Goldman Sachs  said this week that it would only take companies public that had at least one underrepresented board member.CEO David Solomon  said that companies that had gone public in the last four years with at least one female board member did significantly better than those without, but Megan Dickey notes for Extra Crunch that;s not quite all the way towards the goal:But the lack of people of color on boards is perhaps a more urgent issue. Late last year, a Crunchbase study found that 60% of the most funded VC-backed startups don’t have a single woman on their board of directors. But there are even fewer black people, let alone black women, on boards. A 2018 Deloitte study found that of the Fortune 100 companies, white men held 61.4% of board seats, white women held 19.1%, men of color had 13.7% of board seats and women of color had just 5.8% of board seats.Connie Loizos,  meanwhile, writes for TechCrunch that boards themselves are not all of the way toward the goal:Let’s be real here. Directors of public companies typically meet just four times a year to review quarterly results. It’s important and necessary, sure. But beyond ensuring that strategic objectives are being met and hopefully making useful introductions to the company, these roles are assigned more importance by industry watchers than they should. (They often pay ludicrous amounts given the work involved, too.)Even pledging that Goldman is only going to take public companies that give back — say 1% of future profits to the NAACP, as one idea — would instantly put the bank in pole position for those founders and investors who truly want to be progressive. Goldman might miss out on a lot of business in the immediate term, we realize, but we’re guessing it’s a gamble that would pay off over time.Around the hornLame LPs, founder referenceability and the future of VC signaling (TC)Why is everyone making OKR software?

Not because of how much money it has raised — the firm has raised more in a single, preceding round — but because of who put the capital to work.On the venture capital front, Danny and Alex also chewed over signaling risk in venture, and why bigger funds are writing earlier and earlier checks.Also on the docket was the latest from Lambda School, which our former co-host and friend Kate Clark wrote.

1937491,2020-01-24T21:10:18,Samasource CEO Leila Janah passes away at 37,"The startup community has lost another moral leader today.Leila Janah, a serial entrepreneur who was the CEO and founder of machine learning training data company Samasource, passed away at the age of 37 due to complications from epithelioid sarcoma, a form of cancer, according to a statement from the company.She focused her career on social and ethical entrepreneurship with the goal of ending global poverty, founding three distinct organizations over her career spanning the for-profit and nonprofit worlds. She was most well-known for Samasource,  which was founded a little more than a decade ago to help machine learning specialists develop better ML models through more complete and ethical training data sets.The company is distinct for delivering AI-driven services to Fortune 100 companies with a global workforce of data specialists, a large number of whom are located in East Africa.How Samasource Helps The World, And A Secret Tattoo Unveiled (Video)Janah and her company were well ahead of their time, as issues related to bias in ML models have become top-of-mind for many product leaders in Silicon Valley today.My TechCrunch colleague Jake Bright had just interviewed Janah several weeks ago, after Samasource raised more than $15 million in venture capital, according to Crunchbase.Samasource raises $14.8M for global AI data biz driven from AfricaIn that interview, Janah spoke of what inspired her to form an AI company in Africa. “I saw huge opportunity for tapping into the incredible depth of … talent in East Africa in the tech world,” she said of Samasource;s origins.Michael Stewart/WireImageThe company has a global staff of 2,900 and is the largest AI and data annotation employer in East Africa, Janah told TechCrunch.She discussed taking Samasource, and its largely African workforce, from nonprofit to for-profit status. “As a CEO I need to make it clear to investors that this is an investible entity,” she said. Janah shared her view that providing for-profit AI training data to global companies can be done while improving lives in East Africa. “I strongly believe you can combine the highest quality of service with the core mission of altruism,” she said.“A big part of our values is offering living wages and creating dignified technology work for people. We hire people from low-income backgrounds and offer them training in AI and machine learning. And our teams achieve above the industry standard.”In an unpublished segment of her last TechCrunch interview, Janah underscored her commitment to gender diversity in tech. ;We are probably the only firm in our space that has a female CEO, a female COO … and over 60% of our management are women. That;s highly unusual in the tech world,; she said.In a statement on Janah;s passing, Samasource said:We are all committed to continuing Leila’s work, and to ensuring her legacy and vision is carried out for years to come. To accomplish this, Wendy Gonzalez, longtime business partner and friend to Leila, will take the helm as interim CEO of Samasource. Previously the organization’s COO, Wendy has spent the past five years working alongside Leila to craft Samasource’s vision and strategy.In addition to Samasource, Janah founded SF-based Samaschool, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to helping low-income workers learn critical freelancing skills by helping them negotiate the changing dynamics in the freelance economy. The organization has built partnerships with groups like Goodwill to empower them to offer additional curricular resources within their own existing programs and initiatives.Photo by Marla Aufmuth/Getty Images for Watermark Conference for Women 2016Janah also founded LXMI, a skin-care brand that emphasized organic and fair-trade ingredients, with a focus on sourcing from low-income women;s cooperatives in East Africa. Founded three years ago, the company raised a seed round from the likes of NEA, Sherpa and Reid Hoffman, according to Crunchbase.Across all of her initiatives, Janah consistently put the concerns of under-represented people at the forefront, and designed organizations to empower such people in their daily lives. Her entrepreneurial spirit, commitment and integrity will be sorely missed in the startup community.TechCrunch editor-at-large Josh Constine had this to say of Janah’s impact:Leila was propulsive. Being around her, you’d swear there were suddenly more hours in the day just based on how much she could accomplish. Yet rather than conjuring that energy through ruthless efficiency, she carried on with grace and boundless empathy. Whether for her closest friends or a village of strangers on the other side of the world, she embraced others’ challenges as her own. Leila turned vulnerability into an advantage, making people feel so comfortable in her presence that they could unwind their personal and professional puzzles.

1937339,2020-01-24T13:10:41,Kraftful raises $1M to help smart home companies make better apps,"If a thousand companies make their own smart light bulb, do a thousand companies also have to design a light switch app to control them?Kraftful, a company out of Y Combinator;s Summer 2019 class, doesn;t think so. Kraftful  builds the myriad components that an IoT/smart home company might need, puzzle piecing them together into apps for each company without requiring them to reinvent the light switch (or the padlock button, or the smart thermostat dial) for the nth time.Because no company wants an app that looks identical to a competitor;s, much of what Kraftful produces is built to be tailored to each company;s branding — all the surface-level stuff, like iconography, fonts, colors, etc. are all customizable. Under the hood, though, everything is built to be reusable.This focus on finding the parts that can be built once makes sense, especially given the team;s background. CEO Yana Welinder and CTO Nicky Leach were previously head of Product and a senior engineer, respectively, at IFTTT — the web service made up of a zillion reusable, interlinking ;recipe; applets that let you hook just about anything (Gmail, Instagram, your cat;s litter box, whatever) into anything else to let one trigger actions on the other.Kraftful founders Nicky Leach and Yana WelinderSo why now? More smart devices are coming onto the market every day, many of them from legacy appliance companies that don;t have much (or any) history in building smartphone apps. Good apps are the exception — the Philips Hue app is one of the better ones out there, and even it;s a little wonky sometimes. Many of them are; really bad.Bad apps get bad App Store reviews, and bad reviews dent sales. And even for those who dive in and buy it without checking the reviews first, bad apps means returned devices. According to this iQor survey from 2018, 22% of smart home customers give up and return the products before getting them to work.;We kind of looked around and realized that 80% of all smart home apps have zero, one or two stars on the App Store,; Welinder tells me.Knowing what;s working and what;s not with buyers is a strength of Kraftful;s approach; behind the scenes, they can run all sorts of analytics on how users are actually interacting with components in the apps they;re powering and adjust all of them accordingly. If they make a tweak to the setup process in one app, do more users actually get all the way through it? Great. Now roll that out everywhere.;If you look at some of the leading smart lock apps, they all have very; very similar interfaces. They;ve basically gotten to a standardized user experience, but they;ve all be developed individually,; says Welinder. ;So all of these companies are spending the resources designing and developing these apps, but they;re not getting the benefit of being standardized across the board and being able to leverage data from all of these apps to be able to improve them all at once;Kraftful builds the app for both iOS and Android, tailors it to the brand;s needs, offers cloud functionality like push notifications and activity history, provides analytics for insights on how users are actually using an app and keeps everything working as OS updates roll out and as device display sizes grow ever larger.Of course, the entire concept of a dedicated app for a smart home device has some pretty fierce competition — between Apple;s HomeKit and Google Home, the platform makers themselves seem pretty set on gobbling up much of the functionality. But most buyers still expect their shiny devices to have their own apps — something branded and purpose-built, something for the manual to point them to. Power users, meanwhile, will always want to do things beyond what the all-encompassing solutions like HomeKit/Home are built for.Folks at Google seem to agree with Kraftful;s approach — the team counts the Google Assistant Investments Program as one of the investors in the $1 million they;ve raised. Other investors include YC, F7 Ventures, Cleo Capital, Julia Collins (co-founder of Zume Pizza and Planet Forward), Lukas Biewald (co-founder of CrowdFlower), Nicolas Pinto (co-founder of Perceptio) and a number of other angel investors.Welinder tells me they;re already working with multiple companies to start powering their apps; NDAs prevent her from saying who, at this point, but she notes that they;re ;some of the largest brands that provide smart lights, plugs/switches, thermostats and other smart home products.;",https://tcrn.ch/2RO5e2U

A serial entrepreneur, he co-founded Yodlee (YDLE) and Truaxis, both of which were acquired. Previously, he held senior executive positions at LifeLock and Mastercard. He is an inventor on 15 patents.						More posts by this contributor								Are employers the latest financial services disruptors?							We are living through one of the nation’s longest periods of economic growth. Unfortunately, the good times can’t last forever. A recession is likely on the horizon, even if we can’t pinpoint exactly when. Founders can’t afford to wait until the midst of a downturn to figure out their game plans; that would be like initiating swim lessons only after getting dumped in the open ocean.When recession inevitably strikes, it will be many founders’ — and even many VCs’ — first experiences navigating a downturn. Every startup executive needs a recession playbook. The time to start building it is now.While recessions make running any business tough, they don’t necessitate doom. I co-founded two separate startups just before downturns struck, yet I successfully navigated one through the 2000 dot-com bust and the second through the 2008 financial crisis. Both companies not only survived but thrived. One went public and the second was acquired by Mastercard.I hope my lessons learned prove helpful to building your own recession game plan.",https://tcrn.ch/2RMq02H
1937041,2020-01-24T11:01:50,UPDATE: Los Angeles-based CREXi  raises $30 million for its online real estate marketplace,"Los Angeles is one of the most desirable locations for commercial real estate in the United States, so it;s little wonder that there;s something of a boom in investments in technology companies servicing the market coming from the region.It;s one of the reasons that CREXi, the commercial real estate marketplace, was able to establish a strong presence for its digital marketplace and toolkit for buyers, sellers and investors.Since the company raised its last institutional round in 2018, it has added more than 300,000 properties for sale or lease across the U.S. and increased its user base to 6 million customers, according to a statement.It has now raised $30 million in new financing from new investors, including Mitsubishi Estate Company (“MEC”), Industry Ventures  and Prudence Holdings . Previous investors Lerer Hippeau Ventures and Jackson Square Ventures also participated in the financing.CREXi  makes money three ways. There;s a subscription service for brokers looking to sell or lease property; an auction service where CREXi will earn a fee upon the close of a transaction; and a data and analytics service that allows users to get a view into the latest trends in commercial real estate based on the vast collection of properties on offer through the company;s services.The company touts its service as the only technology offering that can take a property from marketing to the close of a sale or lease without having to leave the platform.According to chief executive Mike DeGiorgio, the company is also recession-proof thanks to its auction services. ;As more distressed properties hit the market, the best way to sell them is through an online auction,; DeGiorgio says.So far, the company has seen $700 billion of transactions flow through the platform, and roughly 40% of those deals were exclusive to the company.“The CRE industry is evolving, and market players, especially younger, digitally native generations are seeking out platforms that provide free and open access to information,” said Gavin Myers, general partner at Prudence Holdings, in a statement. “CREXi directly addresses this market need, providing fair access to a range of CRE information. As CREXi continues to build out its stable of services, features, and functionality, we’re thrilled to partner with them and support the company;s continued momentum.”CREXi joins the ranks of startups based in Los Angeles that have raised money to reshape the real estate industry. Estimates from Built in LA count roughly 127 companies, which have raised in excess of $2.4 billion, active in the real estate industry in Los Angeles. These companies range from providers of short-term commercial office space, like Knotel, or co-working companies like WeWork, to companies focused on servicing the real estate industry like Luxury Presence, which raised a $5 million round earlier in the year.Due to inaccurate information provided by the company, an initial version of this story indicated that CREXi had raised $29 million in its Series B round. The correct number is $30 million.",https://tcrn.ch/2vfGGrO
1936919,2020-01-24T06:15:50,"As SaaS stocks set new records, Atlassian;s earnings show there;s still room to grow","Hello and welcome back to our regular morning look at private companies, public markets and the gray space in between.SaaS stocks had a good run in late 2019. TechCrunch covered their ascent, a recovery from early-year doldrums and a summer slowdown. In 2020 so far, SaaS and cloud stocks have surged to all-time highs. The latest records are only a hair higher than what the same companies saw in July of last year, but they represent a return to form all the same.Given that public SaaS companies have now managed to crest their prior highs and have been rewarded for doing so with several days of flat trading, you might think that there isn;t much room left for them to rise. Not so, at least according to Atlassian . The well-known software company reported earnings after-hours yesterday and the market quickly pushed its shares up by more than 10%.Why? It;s worth understanding, because if we know why Atlassian is suddenly worth lots more, we;ll better grok what investors ; public and private ; are hunting for in SaaS companies and how much more room they may have to rise.",https://tcrn.ch/2GgsLEi
1936629,2020-01-24T02:51:46,Meet the B2B videoconferencing startup that;s gone crazy for online dating,"Founder Andreas Kröpfl has spent almost a decade hard-grafting in the B2B unified communications space, building a videoconferencing business with a patented single-stream system and a claim of no ;drop-offs; thanks to ;unique low-bandwidth technology.;His Austria-based startup;s current web-based videoconferencing system, eyeson (née Visocon), which launched in 2018, has had some nice traction since launch, as he tells it, garnering a few million customers and getting a nomination nod as a Gartner Cool Vendor last year.Eyeson;s website touts ;no downloads, no lag, no hassle; video calls. Pricing options for the target B2B users run the gamut from freelance pro to full-blown enterprise. The business itself has pulled in a smidge less than $7 million in investor funding over the years.But when TechCrunch came across Kröpfl last December, pitching hard in startup alley at Disrupt Berlin, he was most keen to talk about something else entirely: video dating.That;s because last summer the team decided to branch out by building their own video dating app, reusing their core streaming tech for a consumer-focused social experiment. And after a period of internal beta testing ; which hopefully wasn;t too awkward within a small (up-til-then) B2B-focused team ; they launched an experimental dating app in November in India.The app, called Ahoi, is now generating 100,000 video calls and 250,000 swipes per day, says Kröpfl.This is where he breaks into a giggle. The traction has been crazy, he says. In the staid world of business videoconferencing, you can imagine eyeson;s  team eyeing the booming growth of certain consumer-focused video products rather enviously.Per Kröpfl, they had certainly noticed different desires among their existing users ; which pushed them to experiment. ;We saw that private people like the simple fun features (GIF reactions, ;) and that business meetings were more focused on ;drop-off; [rates] and business features,; he tells us. ;To improve both in one product was not working any more. So eyeson goes business plus SaaS.;;Cloning eyeson but make it social,; is how he sums up the experiment. Ahoi is very evidently an MVP at this stage. It also looks like a pretty brave and/or foolish (depending on your view) full-bore plunge into video dating, with nothing so sophisticated as a privacy screen to prevent any, er, unwanted blushes; (Whereas safety screening is an element we;ve recently seen elsewhere in the category ; see: Blindlee.)There;s also seemingly no way for users to specify the gender they wish to talk to.Instead, Ahoi users state interests by selecting emoji stickers ; such as a car, cat, tennis racket, games console or globetrotter. And, well, it goes without saying that even if you like cars a lot you;re unlikely to change your sexual orientation over the category.There are no generic emoji that could be used to specify a sexual interest in men or women. But, er, there;s a horse;Such limits may explain why Ahoi is generating so many early swipes ; and rather fewer actual calls ; in that the activity sums to (mostly) men looking for women to videochat with and being matched with, er, men.And frustration, sexual or otherwise, probably isn;t the greatest service to try and sell.Still, Kröpfl reckons they;ve landed on a winning formula that makes handy reuse of their core videoconferencing tech ; letting them growth hack in a totally new category. Swipe right to video date.;People are disappointed by perfect profiles on Tinder and the reality when meeting people,; he posits. ;Wasted time. Especially women do not want to be stalked by men pretending to be someone else. We solve both by a real live conversation where only after a call both can decide to be connected or never see each other again.;Notably, marketing around the app does talk rather fuzzily about it being a way to ;find new pals.;So while Kröpfl frames the experiment as dating, the reality of the product is more ;open to options.; Think of it as a bit like Chatroulette ; just with slightly more control (in that you have a few seconds to decide if you don;t want to talk to the next in-app match).The very short countdown timer (you get just five seconds to opt out of a matched video chat) is very likely generating a fair number of unintended calls. Though such high-velocity matching might appeal to a certain kind of speed dating addict.Kröpfl says Ahoi has been seeing up to 20,000 new users added daily. They;re bullishly targeting 3 million-plus users this year, and already toying with ideas for turning video dates into a money spinner by offering stuff like premium subscriptions and/or video ads. He says the plan is to turn Ahoi into a business ;step by step.;;Everyone loves to make his profile better,; he suggests, floating monetization options down the line. Quality filtering for a fee is another possibility (;everyone is annoyed by being connected to the wrong people;).They picked India for the test launch because it has a lot of people on the same timezone, a large active mobile user-base and cheap marketing is still ;easily possible.; He also says that dating apps seemed popular there, in their experience. (Albeit, the team presumably didn;t have a great deal of relevant experience in this category ; given Ahoi is an experiment.)The intent is also to open Ahoi to other markets in time too, once they get more accustomed to dealing with all the traffic. Kröpfl notes they had to briefly take the app off the store last month as they worked on adding more server capability.;It is very early and we were not prepared for this usage,; he says, admitting they;ve been ;struggling to work on early feedbacks.; ;We had to make it invisible temporarily ; to improve server capacity and stability.;The contrast in pace of uptake between the stolid (but revenue-generating) world of business meeting-fueled videoconferencing and catnip consumer dating ; which is money-sucking unless or until you can hit a critical mass of usage and get the chance to try applying monetization strategies ; does sound like it;s been rather irresistible to Kröpfl. Asked what it feels like to go from one category to the other he says ;crazy, surprised and thrilling,; adding: ;It is somehow also frustrating when all the intense B2B work is not as closely interesting to people as Ahoi is. But amazing that it is possible thanks to an extremely focused and experienced team. I love it.; TechCrunch;s Manish Singh agreed to brave the local video dating app waters in India to check Ahoi out for us.He reported back not having seen any women using the app. Which we imagine might be a problem for Ahoi;s longer-term prospects ; at least in that market.;I spoke with one guy, who said his friend told him about the app. He said he joined to talk to girls but so far, he is only getting matched with boys,; said Singh. ;I saw several names appear on the app, but all of them were boys, too.;He told us he was left wondering ;why people are on these apps, and why they have so much free time on a weekday.;For ;people; it seems safe to conclude that most of Ahoi;s early adopters are men. As The Wall Street Journal reported back in 2018, India;s women are famously cool on dating apps ; in that they;re mostly not on them. (We asked Kröpfl about Ahoi;s gender breakdown but he didn;t immediately get back to us on that. Update: We;re told the app;s male to female ratio is 85:15. ;India is challenging,; Kröpfl admits.)That market quirk means those female users who are on dating apps tend to get bombarded with messages from all the lonely heart guys with not much to swipe. Which, in turn, could make a video dating app like Ahoi an unattractive prospect to female users ; if there;s any risk at all of being inundated with video chats.And even if there are enough in-app controls to prevent unwelcome inundation by default, women also might not feel like they want their profile to be seen by scores of men simply by merit of being signed up to an app ; as seems inevitable if the gender balance is so skewed.Add to that, if the local perception among single women is that men on dating apps are generally a turn-off ; because they;re too eager/forward ; then jumping into any unmoderated video chat is probably not the kind of safe space these women are looking for.No matter, Kröpfl and his team are clearly having far too much fun growth hacking in an unfamiliar, high-velocity consumer category to sweat the detail. What;s driving Ahoi;s growth right now? ;Performance marketing mainly,; he says, pointing also to ;viral engagement by sharing and liking profiles.;Notably, there are a lot of reviews of Ahoi on Google Play already ; an unusual amount for such an early app. Many of them appear to be five-star write-ups from accounts with European-sounding names and a sometimes robotic grasp of language.;Eventhough Ahoi has been developed recently, it had high quality for user about calling, making friends and widing your knowlegde [sic],; writes one reviewer with atrocious spelling whose account is attached to the name ;Dustin Stephens.;;Talking with like minded people and same favor will creat a fun and interesting atmosphere. Ahoi will manage for you to call like condition above,; says another apparently happy but not entirely clear user, going by the name ;Elisa Herring.;There;s also a ;Madeleine Mcghin,; whose profile uses a photo of the similarly named child who infamously disappeared during a holiday in Portugal in 2007. ;My experience with this app was awesome,; this individual writes. ;It gives me the option to find new people in every country.;Another less instantly tasteless five-star reviewer, ;Stefania Lucchini,; leaves a more surreal form of praise. ;A good app and it will bring you extra income, I would say it;s a great opportunity to have AHOI and be a part of it but it;s that it will automatically ban you even if you don;t show it. Marketing. body part, there are still 5 stars for me,; she (or, well, ;it;) writes.Among the plethora of dubious five-star reviews a couple of one-star dunks stand out ; not least because they come from accounts with names that sound like they might actually come from India. ;Waste u r time,; says one of these, who uses the name ;Prajal Pradhan.;This pithy drop-kick has been given a full 72 thumbs-up by other Play Store users.",https://tcrn.ch/2TTTui2
1937042,2020-01-23T19:46:22,Here are all 21 companies from Alchemist Accelerator;s latest batch,"We;re down in Sunnyvale, Calif., where Alchemist Accelerator is hosting a demo day for its most recent batch of companies. This is the 23rd class to graduate from Alchemist, with notable alums including LaunchDarkly, MightyHive, Matternet and Rigetti Computing. As an enterprise accelerator, Alchemist focuses on companies that make their money from other businesses, rather than consumers.Twenty-one companies presented in all, each getting five minutes to explain their mission to a room full of investors, media and other founders.Here are our notes on all 21 companies, in the order in which they presented:i-5O: Uses AI to monitor human actions on production lines, using computer vision to look for errors or abnormalities along the way. Founder Albert Kao says that 68% of manufacturing issues are caused by human error. The company currently has three paid pilots, totaling $190,000 in contracts.Perimeter: A data visualization platform for firefighters and other first responders, allowing them to more quickly input and share information (such as how a fire is spreading) with each other and the public. Projecting $1.7 million in revenue within 18 months.Einsite: Computer vision-based analytics for mining and construction. Sensors and cameras are mounted on heavy machines (like dump trucks and excavators). Footage is analyzed in the cloud, with the data ultimately presented to job site managers to help monitor progress and identify issues. Founder Anirudh Reddy says the company will have $1.2 million in bookings and be up and running on 2,100 machines this year.Mall IQ: A location-based marketing/analytics SDK for retail stores and malls to tie into their apps. Co-founder Batu Sat says they’ve built an ;accurate and scalable; method of determining a customer’s indoor position without GPS or additional hardware like Bluetooth beacons.Ipsum Analytics: Machine learning system meant to predict the outcome of a company;s ongoing legal cases by analyzing the relevant historical cases of a given jurisdiction, judge, etc. First target customer is hedge funds, helping them project how legal outcomes will impact the market.Vincere Health: Works with insurance companies to pay people to stop smoking. They;ve built an app with companion breathalyzer hardware; each time a user checks in with the breathalyzer to prove they;re smoking less, the user gets paid. They;ve raised $400,000 so far.Harmonize: A chat bot system for automating HR tasks, built to work with existing platforms like Slack and Microsoft Teams. An employee could, for example, message the bot to request time off — the request is automatically forwarded to their manager, presenting them with one-click approve/deny buttons that handle everything behind the scenes. The company says it currently has 400 paying customers and is seeing $500,000 in ARR, projecting $2 million ARR in 2020.Coreshell Technologies: Working on a coating for lithium-ion batteries, which the company says makes them 25% cheaper and 50% faster to produce. The company;s co-founder says they have 11 patents filed, with two paid agreements signed and 12 more in the pipeline.in3D: An SDK for 3D body scanning via smartphone, meant to help apps do things like gather body measurements for custom clothing, allow for virtual clothing try-ons or create accurate digital avatars for games.Domatic: “Intelligent power” for new building construction. Pushes both data and low-voltage power over a single “Class 2” wire, making it easier/cheaper for builders to make a building “smart.” Co-founder Jim Baldwin helped build Firewire at Apple, and co-founder Gladys Wong was previously a hardware engineer at Cisco.MeToo Kit: A kit meant to allow victims of sexual assault or rape to gather evidence through an at-home, self-administered process. Co-founder Madison Campbell says that they;ve seen 100,000 kits ordered by universities, corporations, nonprofits, and military organizations. The company garnered significant controversy in September of 2019 after multiple states issued cease-and-desist letters, with Michigan;s attorney general arguing that such a kit would not be admissible in court. Campbell told BuzzFeed last year that she would ;never stop fighting; for the concept.AiChemist Metal: Building a thin, lightweight battery made of copper and cellulose ;nanofibers.; Co-founder Sergey Lopatin says the company;s solution is 2-3x lighter, stronger and cheaper than alternatives, and that the company is projecting profitability in 2021. Focusing first on batteries for robotics, flexible displays and electric vehicles.Delightree: A task management system for franchises, meant to help owners create and audit to-dos across locations. Monitors online customer reviews, automatically generating potential tasks accordingly. In pilot tests with three brands with 16 brands on a waitlist, which the company says translates to about $400,000 in potential ARR.DigiFabster: An ML-powered ;smart quoting; tool for manufacturing shops doing things like CNC machining to make custom parts and components. Currently working with 125 customers, they;re seeing $500,000 in ARR.NachoNacho: Helps small/medium businesses monitor and manage software subscriptions their employees sign up for. Issues virtual credit cards, which small businesses use to sign up for services; you can place budgets on each card, cancel cards and quickly determine where your money is going. Launched nine months ago, NachoNacho says it;s currently working with more than 1,600 businesses.Zapiens: A virtual assistant-style tool for sharing knowledge within a company, tied into tools like Slack/Salesforce/Microsoft 365. Answers employee questions, or uses its understanding of each employee’s expertise to find someone within the company who can answer the question.Onebrief: A tool aiming to make military planning more efficient. Co-founder/Army officer Grant Demaree says that much of the military;s planning is buried in Word/PowerPoint documents, with inefficiencies leading to ballooning team sizes. By modernizing the planning approach with a focus on visualization, automation and data re-usability, he says planning teams could be smaller yet more agile.Perceive: Spatial analytics for physical spaces such as showrooms. Builds a sensor that hooks into existing lighting wiring to create a 3D map of a space, analyzing customer movement/behavior (without face recognition or Wi-Fi/beacon tracking) to improve customer experiences through data.Acoustic Wells: IoT devices for monitoring and controlling production from oil fields. Analyzes sound from pipes ;10,000 feet underground; to regulate how a machine is running, optimizing production while minimizing waste. Charges monthly fee per oil well. Currently has letters of intent to roll out their solution in over 1,000 wells.SocialGlass: A marketplace for government procurement. Lets governments buy goods/services valued under $10,000 without going through a bidding process, with SocialGlass guaranteeing they;ve found the cheapest price.

1936899,2020-01-23T14:27:46,Playing traffic cop for drones in cities and towns nets Airspace Link $4 million,"As the number of drones proliferates in cities and towns across America, government agencies are scrambling to find ways to manage the oncoming traffic that;s expected to clog up their airspace.Companies like Airmap and KittyHawk have raised tens of millions to develop technologies that can help cities manage congestion in the friendly skies, and now they have a new competitor in the Detroit-based startup, Airspace Link, which just raised $4 million from a swarm of investors to bring its services to the broader market.The financing for Airspace Link  follows the company;s reception of a stamp of approval from the Federal Aviation Administration  for low-altitude authorization and notification capabilities, according to chief executive Michael Healander.According to Healander, what distinguishes Airspace Link from the other competitors in the market is its integration with mapping tools used by municipal governments to provide information on ground-based risk.;We;re creating the roads based on ground-based risk and we push that out into the drone community to let them know where it;s okay to fly,; says Healander.That knowledge of terrestrial critical assets in cities and towns comes from deep integrations between Airspace Link and the mapping company ESRI, which has long provided federal, state and local governments with mapping capabilities and services.;We’ve just spent the past month understanding what regulation is going to be around to support it. In two years from now every drone will be live tracked in our platform,; says Healnder. ;Today we’re just authorizing flight plans.;As drone operators increase in number, the autonomous vehicles pose more potential risks to civilian populations in the wrong hands.Parking lots, sporting events, concerts ; really any public area ; could be targets for potential attacks using drones.;Drones are becoming more and more powerful and smarter,; EU Security Commissioner Julian King warned in a statement last summer, ;which makes them more and more attractive for legitimate use, but also for hostile acts.;Already roughly half of the population of the U.S. lives in controlled airspace where drones flying with more than a half a pound of weight require flight plan authorization, according to Healander.;We build out population data and give state and local governments a tool to create advisories for emergency events or any areas where high densities of people will be,; says Healander. ;That creates an advisory that goes through our platform to the drone industry.;Airspace Link closed a $1 million pre-seed round in September 2019 with a $6 million post-money valuation. The current valuation of the company is undisclosed, but the company;s progress was enough to draw the attention of investors led by Indicator Ventures with participation from 2048 Ventures, Ludlow Ventures,  Matchstick Ventures, Detroit Venture Partners and Invest Detroit.For Healander, Airspace Link is only the latest entrepreneurial venture. He previously founded GeoMetri, an indoor GPS tracking company, which was acquired by Acuity Brands.I’ve been a partner of ESRI my entire life,; says Healander. ;I’ve been in the geospatial industry for four or five companies with them.;The company has four main components of its service. There;s AirRegistry, where people can opt-in or out of receiving drone deliveries; AirInspect, which is a service that handles city and state permitting for drone operators; AirNetm, which works with the FAA to create approved air routes for drones; and AirLink, an API that connects drone operators with local governments and collects fees for registering drones.",https://tcrn.ch/2O9IsSb

Recode reported last year that Quora was locking down $60 million at a $2 billion valuation, noting at the time that the startup had around 200 employees. The company has publicly disclosed $225 million to date according to Crunchbase, from investors including Benchmark, Peter Thiel and Y Combinator.We;ve reached out to the company for additional comment.;[W]e need to reduce our burn rate to a sustainable level from which we can focus on pursuing the mission and growing the business over the long term. We do not want to be dependent on outside capital, so self-reliance and careful management of our resources are crucial to our future,; D;Angelo wrote.Over the past several weeks, layoffs have been hitting startups, including several in SoftBank;s portfolio as well as Mozilla and, just today, genetic testing startup 23andMe.Layoffs reach 23andMe after hitting Mozilla and the Vision Fund portfolio",https://tcrn.ch/2RNwBdv
1936788,2020-01-23T11:10:24,Layoffs reach 23andMe after hitting Mozilla and the Vision Fund portfolio,"Layoffs in the technology and venture-backed worlds continued today, as 23andMe confirmed to CNBC that it laid off around 100 people, or about 14% of its formerly 700-person staff. The cuts would be notable by themselves, but given how many other reductions have recently been announced, they indicate that a rolling round of belt-tightening amongst well-funded private companies continues. (TechCrunch confirmed the numbers with the company.)Mozilla, for example, cut 70 staffers earlier this year. As TechCrunch;s Frederic Lardinois reported earlier in January, the company;s revenue-generating products were taking longer to reach market than expected. And with less revenue coming in than expected, its human footprint had to be reduced.Tech layoffs rise as cost-cutting comes into vogue23andMe  and Mozilla are not alone, however. Playful Studios cut staff just this week, 2019 itself saw more than 300% more tech layoffs than in the preceding year and TechCrunch has covered a litany of layoffs at Vision Fund-backed companies over the past few months, including:Staff cuts at Zume, the startup famous for considering making mobile pizza robotsPersonnel reductions at Rappi, an e-commerce companyCuts at Getaround, a car rental serviceLayoffs at Oyo, a budget hotel unicornScooter unicorns Lime and Bird have also reduced staff this year. The for-profit drive is firing on all cylinders in the wake of the failed WeWork IPO attempt. WeWork was an outlier in terms of how bad its financial results were, but the fear it introduced to the market appears pretty damn mainstream by this point. (Forsake hope, alle ye whoe require a Series H.)The money at risk, let alone the human cost, is high. Zume has raised more than $400 million. 23andMe has raised an even sharper $786.1 million. Rappi? How about $1.4 billion. And Oyo? $3.2 billion so far. Every company that loses money eventually dies. And every company that always makes money lives forever. It seems that lots of companies want to jump over the fence, make some money and rebuild investor confidence in their shares.It;s just too bad that the rank-and-file are taking the brunt of the correction.",https://tcrn.ch/3aBOzbb

Cortex Labs is an early-stage startup with some open-source tooling designed to help data scientists take that last step.The company;s founders were students at Berkeley when they observed that one of the problems around creating machine learning models was finding a way to deploy them. While there was a lot of open-source tooling available, data scientists are not experts in infrastructure.CEO Omer Spillinger says that infrastructure was something the four members of the founding team ; himself, CTO David Eliahu, head of engineering Vishal Bollu and head of growth Caleb Kaiser ; understood well.What the four founders did was take a set of open-source tools and combine them with AWS services to provide a way to deploy models more easily. ;We take open-source tools like TensorFlow, Kubernetes and Docker and we combine them with AWS services like CloudWatch, EKS (Amazon;s flavor of Kubernetes) and S3 to basically give one API for developers to deploy their models,; Spillinger explained.He says that a data scientist starts by uploading an exported model file to S3 cloud storage. ;Then we pull it, containerize it and deploy it on Kubernetes behind the scenes. We automatically scale the workload, and let you switch to GPUs if it;s compute intensive. We stream logs and expose [the model] to the web. We help you manage security around that, stuff like that,; he said.While he acknowledges this is not unlike Amazon SageMaker, the company;s long-term goal is to support all of the major cloud platforms. SageMaker, of course, only works on the Amazon cloud, while Cortex will eventually work on any cloud. In fact, Spillinger says the biggest feature request they;ve gotten to this point is to support Google Cloud. He says that and support for Microsoft Azure are on the road map.The Cortex founders have been keeping their head above water while they wait for a commercial product with the help of an $888,888 seed round from Engineering Capital in 2018. If you;re wondering about that oddly specific number, it;s partly an inside joke ; Spillinger;s birthday is August 8th ; and partly a number arrived at to make the valuation work, he said.For now, the company is offering the open-source tools, and building a community of developers and data scientists. Eventually, it wants to monetize by building a cloud service for companies that don;t want to manage clusters ; but that is down the road, Spillinger said.",https://tcrn.ch/2RniuME

1936603,2020-01-23T08:00:11,"Brooke Hammerling launches The New New Thing, a strategic communications advisory","Brooke Hammerling, the strategic communications veteran who brought us Brew PR, announced her new project today.Dubbed The New New Thing, Hammerling;s new communications advisory wants to help startups bring more authenticity to brand messaging and comms through high-level partnerships with CEOs, founders and executive leadership teams.There are a few critical pieces to The New New Thing:First, Hammerling will not focus on the usual six-month press release strategy that drives communications at most tech startups. The New New Thing isn;t focused as much on an individual product or funding round announcement as much as the high-level strategy of storytelling across the entire brand, including the company and the founder. In fact, the only pre-launch clients Hammerling will be taking on must be female-led and mission-driven.Second, she;ll be working directly with startup leadership teams to craft those narratives paying special attention to the stories in between the stories.And finally, The New New Thing will have a huge focus on authenticity as a driver of relationships between its clients and the media.One catalyst for the new project, according to Hammerling, was the evolution of the comms landscape as a whole. Not only is the media;s bullshit detector hyper-sensitive, but so is the end-reader. It;s no longer enough to send out the same robotic press release announcing funding.;I;m bored of seeing the same picture of two male founders announcing their funding for some fintech product that;s going to change the world,; said Hammerling. ;There needs to be a fostering of the relationships between CEOs and the people telling their story. Being authentic is really hard for larger organizations, or really any organization. And now, in 2020, there is no option but to be.;Hammerling explained that getting into the weeds with founders and tackling a storytelling challenge is what she loves doing most. She admits that managing a large team and dealing with the nitty gritty of comms (writing up press releases, pitching speakers for tech conferences, etc.) aren;t her strong suits.As you might imagine, the launch of The New New Thing means that Hammerling has officially left Brew PR, the firm she founded and sold to Freuds for $15 million.Brooke Hammerling on how early-stage startups should think about PRThe New New Thing is part of a newly expanded collective of service providers called Plan A, led by co-CEOs MT Carney and Andrew Essex. Plan A combines expert service providers from the fields of communications, branding, advertising, creative and social, among others.Hammerling will be focusing on early and growth-stage startups in the tech industry, with a current client list that includes Lemonade, LiveNation, Framebridge, Splice and Eko.One example of how The New New Thing works is made clear with Splice. The company is represented by a PR firm that manages the day-to-day news cycle and announcement schedule, while Hammerling works directly with founder and CEO Steve Martocci on the overall narrative that runs through all of that.When asked about the greatest challenge moving forward, Hammerling;s answer offered a taste of the authenticity and relatability she;s trying to bring out of her clients.;Can I do this? Do I have the right instincts and guidance for my clients?; said Hammerling. ;I think I do and I;ve been successful at that, but how do I maintain that and communicate that to others?;",https://tcrn.ch/2sPMCqD
1936618,2020-01-23T06:46:27,Revolut partners with Flagstone to offer savings vaults in the UK,"Fintech startup Revolut lets you earn interest on your savings thanks to a new feature called savings vaults. That feature is currently only available to users living in the U.K. and paying taxes in the U.K.The company has partnered with Flagstone for that feature. For now, the feature is limited to Revolut customers with a Metal subscription (£12.99 per month or £116 per year). But Revolut  says that it will be available to Revolut Premium and Standard customers in the near future.Savings vaults work pretty much like normal vaults. You can create sub-accounts in the Revolut app to put some money aside. And Revolut offers you multiple ways to save. You can round up all your card transactions to the nearest pound and save spare change in a vault.You also can set up weekly or monthly transactions from your main account to a vault. And, of course, you can transfer money manually whenever you want.Metal customers in the U.K. can now turn normal vaults into savings vaults. The only difference is that you’re going to earn interest — Revolut pays that interest daily. You can take money from your savings vault whenever you want.Revolut promises 1.35% AER interest rate up to a certain limit. If you put a huge sum of money in your savings vault, you’ll get a lower interest rate above the limit. Your money is protected by the FSCS up to a value of £85,000 for eligible customers.",https://tcrn.ch/30NHEap
1936549,2020-01-23T06:00:56,"Crisp, the demand forecast platform for the food industry, goes live","The food industry may be the biggest industry in the world, but it;s also one of the least efficient. BCG says 1.6 billions tons of food, worth $1.2 trillion, is wasted in food every year, and those numbers are only expected to go up.A number of players have stepped up to try to solve their own portion of the problem, and one such solution is Crisp. The company, which received $14 million in Series A funding last year led by FirstMark Capital, is today going live with its platform (which has been in beta).Crisp aims to solve the global food waste problem via demand forecasts. Founder and CEO Are Traasdahl, a serial founder, believes that a lack of communication and data flow between the many players in the supply chain is a main cause for all this waste, a great deal of which happens long before the food reaches the consumer.Right now, forecasting demand is nowhere close to a perfect science for many of these players. From food brands to distributors to grocery stores, the problem is usually solved by looking at a spreadsheet from last year;s sales to try to determine the signals that played into this or that SKU;s sales performance.And then there was Crisp.Integrated with almost any ERP software a company might have, Crisp ingests historical data from these food brands and combines that data with signals around other demand drivers, such as seasonality, holidays, price sensitivity and other pricing information, marketing campaigns, competitive landscape, weather that might affect the sale or shipment of certain produce or other ingredients.Using these data points, and historical sales data, Crisp believes it can give a much more accurate picture of demand over the next day, week, month or year.But Crisp isn;t just for food brands, such as Nounós Creamery, a Crisp customer that says its reduced scrapped inventory by 80% since switching to the platform. Crisp serves almost every player in the food supply chain, from retailers to distributors to brands to brokers.And the more customers it gets, the better it is at predicting demand on a very specific level. For instance, the demand forecasting Crisp offers for a particular grocery store, based on external data, will obviously get much better once that grocery store is a customer on the platform.Traasdahl was initially concerned that his customers would be reluctant to hand over this type of sensitive sales data, and also that players within the industry might be anxious to hand over such data to a platform that;s aggregating everyone;s data, including their competitors;. Turns out, the food industry has more of a ;better together; mentality.;Other industries are not as dependent on each other,; said Traasdahl. ;If I am a creamery and need to buy blueberries for my yogurt, I may have five different vendors for those blueberries. And if they don;t get delivered on the right day, Costco will yell at me for being late with the yogurt. Everyone in the supply chain is somewhat dependent on each other.;For that reason, it;s been easier than expected to attract clients to the platform. The prospect of a collaborative demand forecast platform, which is pulling signals from across the entire industry, is going to be more accurate than siloed demand forecasts produced by a single vendor or brand.During the beta program, which launched in October, Crisp brought on more than 30 companies to the platform, including Gilbert’s Craft Sausages, SunFed Perfect Produce, Nounós Creamery, Hofseth, REMA and Superior Farms.",https://tcrn.ch/2RHGr0q
1936473,2020-01-22T21:21:44,Indian bike rental startup Bounce raises $105M,"Bounce, a Bangalore-based startup that operates more than 20,000 electric and gasoline dockless bikes and scooters in nearly three dozen cities in India, said today it has raised $105 million in a new funding round as it explores sustainable ways to expand within the nation and build its own electric vehicles.The new financing round, a Series D, was co-led by existing investors Eduardo Saverin’s  B Capital and Accel Partners, the startup said. The new round valued Bounce at a little over $500 million, up from about $200 million in June last year, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.TechCrunch reported in late November that Bounce was in advanced stages of talks to raise $150 million at over $500 million valuation. The new round pushes the startup;s total raise to $194 million.Bounce, formerly known as Metro Bikes, allows customers to rent a scooter and pay as low as 1 Indian rupee (0.15 cents) for the first kilometer of the ride. The startup, which clocks 120,000 rides each day, allows users to leave the vehicle in any nearby docking station or partnered mom-and-pop store after the ride.Bounce earlier deployed its own operations team in each city and flooded the market with its scooters, but in recent weeks it has started to explore a new strategy, said co-founder and chief executive Vivekananda Hallekere in an interview with TechCrunch.“We realized that it was not the most efficient move to expand Bounce’s network on our own,” he said. The startup now works with mom-and-pop stores and local merchants in each city and they run their own operations.Millions of mom-and-pop stores dot cities, towns and villages in India. In recent years, scores of startups and companies have started to work with them to address the last-mile challenge. Amazon said earlier this month that it has partnered with more than 20,000 mom-and-pop stores in the nation to use them to store and deliver packages.To date, Bounce has replicated this model in six cities in India (including Vijayawada and Mangalore), and has partnered with more than 250,000 shops and merchants. “We launch in the cities with our own vehicles, but over time, these micro-entrepreneurs deploy their own bikes and scooters. They are still using our app, and are part of the Bounce platform, but they don’t have to be locked into our scooter ecosystem,” he explained.The shift in strategy comes as Bounce looks to cut expenses and find a sustainable way to expand. “Otherwise, I would need a billion dollar of debt to launch a million vehicles in India,” he said. ;We wanted a model that is scalable and profitable, and helps us create the most impact.;Bounce is part of a small group of startups that is attempting to address a market that cab-hailing services Uber  and Ola have been unable to tackle. The startup competes with Vogo, which is backed by Ola, and Yulu, which maintains a partnership with Uber.Riding these bikes is more affordable than hailing a cab, and also two wheels are much faster in the crowded traffic of urban cities. These bikes have also proven useful in other ways. Hallekere said female passengers access more than 30% of rides on Bounce ; a figure that beats the industry estimates, because women feel much safer with bikes, he said. ;They don;t have to worry about how they would commute back from work,; he said.Bounce is also working on building its own ecosystem of electric vehicles. The startup said it has already built a scooter with a metal chassis that can survive for at least 200,000 kilometers. The idea is to build electric scooters that work best for shared mobility, something Hallekere said the ecosystem is currently missing.;In our tests, we found that even if you threw this bike from the first floor of a building, nothing happens to it. It is also more tech-enabled, so it can tell when the second seat of the bike is in use and can bill users accordingly, for instance,; he explained. The startup plans to deploy these vehicles in the coming months.Kabir Narang, a partner at B Capital, told TechCrunch in an interview that he sees great potential in the shared mobility future in India, and Bounce team;s passion and commitment to solving these challenges made it easy for them to place their ;long-term; bet on the startup.",https://tcrn.ch/2RGaxRL
1936371,2020-01-22T21:00:36,Proxyclick raises $15M Series B for its visitor management platform,"If you;ve ever entered a company;s office as a visitor or contractor, you probably know the routine: check in with a receptionist, figure out who invited you, print out a badge and get on your merry way. Brussels, Belgium and New York-based Proxyclick aims to streamline this process, while also helping businesses keep their people and assets secure. As the company announced today, it has raised a $15 million Series B round led by Five Elms Capital, together with previous investor Join Capital.In total, Proxyclick  says its systems have now been used to register more than 30 million visitors in 7,000 locations around the world. In the U.K. alone, more than 1,000 locations use the company;s tools. Current customers include L;Oréal, Vodafone, Revolut, PepsiCo and Airbnb, as well as a number of other Fortune 500 firms.Gregory Blondeau, founder and CEO of Proxyclick, stresses that the company believes that paper logbooks, which are still in use in many companies, are simply not an acceptable solution anymore, not in the least because that record is often permanent and visible to other visitors.Proxyclick;s founding team.;We all agree it is not acceptable to have those paper logbooks at the entrance where everyone can see previous visitors,; he said. ;It is also not normal for companies to store visitors’ digital data indefinitely. We already propose automatic data deletion in order to respect visitor privacy. In a few weeks, we’ll enable companies to delete sensitive data such as visitor photos sooner than other data. Security should not be an excuse to exploit or hold visitor data longer than required.;What also makes Proxyclick stand out from similar solutions is that it integrates with a lot of existing systems for access control (including C-Cure and Lenel systems). With that, users can ensure that a visitor only has access to specific parts of a building, too.In addition, though, it also supports existing meeting rooms, calendaring and parking systems, and integrates with Wi-Fi credentialing tools so your visitors don;t have to keep asking for the password to get online.Like similar systems, Proxyclick provides businesses with a tablet-based sign-in service that also allows them to get consent and NDA signatures right during the sign-in process. If necessary, the system also can compare the photos it takes to print out badges with those on a government-issued ID to ensure your visitors are who they say they are.Blondeau noted that the whole industry is changing, too. ;Visitor management is becoming mainstream, it is transitioning from a local, office-related subject handled by facility managers to a global, security and privacy-driven priority handled by chief information security officers. Scope, decision drivers and key people involved are not the same as in the early days,; he said.It;s no surprise then that the company plans to use the new funding to accelerate its roadmap. Specifically, it;s looking to integrate its solution with more third-party systems with a focus on physical security features and facial recognition, as well as additional new enterprise features.",https://tcrn.ch/30Lvteg

1936207,2020-01-22T11:04:48,Unito raises $10.5M to help workplace collaboration tools speak to each other,"Startup productivity tools have never been better, but that;s led to employees being more passionate than ever about the tools they want to use themselves. PMs don;t want to use Jira, engineers don;t want to mess with Trello and keeping everyone happy can mean replicating processes again and again.Montreal-based Unito is building software that helps these platforms communicate with each other so teams can keep their favorite tools without bringing the company to a crawl. The startup has just closed a $10.5 million Series A round led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from existing investors Mistral Venture Partners, Real Ventures and Tom Williams.Unito;s  tool works by collaborating among most of the major workplace productivity software suites; APIs and automatically translating an action in one piece of software to the others. Updates, comments and due dates can then sync across each of the apps, allowing employees to only interact with the software that;s best for their job.For Unito, the challenge is convincing startups that are paying for more subscription tools than ever that they need another tool to make sense of what they already have. Unito CEO Marc Boscher tells TechCrunch that company leaders are already having to deal with impassioned pleas for adopting or abandoning certain tools, something that his product can alleviate.;Every company;s got a debate about which tools to use to get their work done and track their work, and it;s never the same, so someone has to lose out eventually,; Boscher says. ;People are becoming really passionate about their tools whether they love them or hate them.;Venture capitalists have been increasingly pouring money into SaaS products built for specific workflows. For employees that have long had to deal with software built for someone else;s role, the proliferation of more team-specific software has been welcome ; but the ease of use comes with the danger that data or updates can get siloed.Bessemer partner Jeremy Levine led this deal, saying that the firm was attracted to Unito after seeing how the product allowed teams to choose their own tools, something that was becoming more critical amid the proliferation of vertical-specific SaaS products. Levine;s other early-stage bets include Shopify, Yelp and LinkedIn.Unito;s current integrations include tools like Jira, Asana, Trello, GitHub, Basecamp, Wrike, ZenDesk, Bitbucket, GitLab and HubSpot.Seed investors favor enterprise over consumer for first time this decade",https://tcrn.ch/2ut9JaT
1935626,2020-01-22T09:17:56,"Bear Robotics, a company making robot waiters, just raised a $32 million round led by SoftBank","Back in August, we flagged a filing for you that we found interesting, one for a now 2.5-year-old, 40-person Redwood City, Calif.,-based startup called Bear Robotics that;s been developing robots to deliver food to restaurant customers. The filing listed a $35.8 million target; Bear Robotics  founder and CEO John Ha now tells us the final close, being announced today, was $32 million in Series A funding.The round was led by SoftBank Group,  whose other recent robotics bets include the currently beleaguered food truck company Zume and, as we reported yesterday, Berkshire Grey, a seven-year-old, Lexington, Mass.-based company that makes pick, pack and sorting robots for fulfillment centers and that just raised a whopping $263 million in Series B funding led by SoftBank.Because we know you;re interested in much more than Bear Robotics; funding picture, we asked Ha ; a former Intel research scientist turned technical lead at Google who in recent years opened and closed his own restaurant ; to share more about the company and its robot servers.TC: You were an engineer at Google. Why then start your own restaurant?JH: It;s not like I had a dream of having a restaurant; it was more of an investment. It sounded fun, but it didn;t turn out to be fun. What I was really shocked by was how much hard work is involved and how low [employees;] income is. I felt [as I was forced to close it] that this was going to be my life;s work ; to transform the restaurant industry with the skills I have. I wanted to remove the hard work and the repetitive tasks so that humans can focus on the truly human side, the hospitality. At restaurants, you;re selling food and service, but most of your time is spent dealing with hiring people and people not showing up, and I suspect our product will change [the equation].TC: How did you come up with the first idea or iteration of the robot you;ve created, that you;re calling Penny?JH: First, me and my restaurant staff constantly discussed, ;If we have this robot, what would it look like and what capacity and features would it need?; I knew it couldn;t be too big; robots have to be able to move well in narrow spaces. We also focused on the right capacity. And we didn;t want to make a robotic restaurant. I wanted to build a robot that no one really cares about; it;s just in the background, sort of like R2-D2 to Luke Skywalker. It;s a sidekick ; a bland robot with a weak personality to get things done for your master.TC Let;s talk parts. How are these things built?JH: It;s self-driving tech that;s been adopted for indoor space, so it can safely navigate from Point A to Point B. A server puts the food on Penny, and it finds a way to get to the table. It has a two-wheel differential drive, plus casters. It;s pretty safe. A lot of similar-looking robots have blind spots, but ours doesn;t. It can detect baby hands on the floor ; even something as thin as a wallet that;s fallen from someone;s table.We;re not using robot arms because it;s very difficult to make it 100% safe when you have arms in a crowded space. The material ; it;s going to be plastic ; is safe and easy to clean and able to work with the sanitizers and detergents used in restaurants. We;ve also had to make sure the wheels won;t accumulate food waste, because that would cause issues with the health department.TC: So this isn;t out in the world yet.JH: We haven;t entered the mass-manufacturing phase yet.TC: Where will these be built, and how will you charge for them?JH: They;ll be made somewhere in Asia ; maybe China or some other country. And we haven;t figured out pricing yet but restaurants will be leasing these, not buying them, and there will be a monthly subscription fee that they are paying for a white-glove service, so they don;t have to worry about maintenance or support.TC: How customizable are these Penny robots going to be? Are there different tiers of service?JH: Penny can be configured into several modes. The default is [for it to hold] three trays, so it can carry food to a table or a server can use it for busing help.TC: Will it address the customers?JH: Penny can speak and play sound, but it;s not conversational yet. It can say, ;Please take your food,; or play music while it;s moving. That;s where customers may want to personalize the robot for their own purposes.TC: Ultimately, the idea is for this to be sold where ; just restaurants?JH: Wherever food is served, so it;s being tested right now in some restaurants, casinos, some homes. [I;m sure we;ll add] nursing homes, too.",https://tcrn.ch/30OMhBk

Learn about the cutting edge (sometimes literally) of agricultural robots at TC Sessions: Robotics+AI on March 3 with the founders of Traptic, Pyka and FarmWise.Traptic, and its co-founder and CEO Lewis Anderson, you may remember from Disrupt SF 2019, where it was a finalist in the Startup Battlefield. The company has developed a robotic berry picker that identifies ripe strawberries and plucks them off the plants with a gentle grip. It could be the beginning of a new automated era for the fruit industry, which is decades behind grains and other crops when it comes to machine-based harvesting.Traptic uses 3D vision and robotic arms to harvest ripe strawberriesFarmWise has a job that;s equally delicate yet involves rough treatment of the plants — weeding. Its towering machine trundles along rows of crops, using computer vision to locate and remove invasive plants, working 24/7, 365 days a year. CEO Sebastian Boyer will speak to the difficulty of this task and how he plans to evolve the machines to become ;doctors; for crops, monitoring health and spontaneously removing pests like aphids.Pyka;s  robot is considerably less earthbound than those: an autonomous, all-electric crop-spraying aircraft — with wings! This is a much different challenge from the more stable farming and spraying drones like those of DroneSeed and SkyX, but the choice gives the craft more power and range, hugely important for today;s vast fields. Co-founder Michael Norcia can speak to that scale and his company;s methods of meeting it.Pyka and its autonomous, electric crop-spraying drone land $11M seed roundThese three companies and founders are at the very frontier of what;s possible at the intersection of agriculture and technology, so expect a fruitful conversation.$150 early-bird savings end on January 31!

1936061,2020-01-22T08:00:34,"Substack builds multi-author support into its hybrid publishing, newsletter service","Substack announced today that it has built support for multiple authors into its service. The company provides a publishing tool that blends blogs and email newsletters into a single entity, with a focus on subscription monetization.The day;s updates also include a number of publisher-friendly tools, like shared access and homepage features closer to those of traditional websites than the linear timeline style that Substack has focused on so far.The additions, which also include nice-to-haves like author pages for multi-person publications, mark a new level of maturity for Substack, a service that quickly attracted both authors and an audience after it launched. That early traction helped the company land an outsized ; when compared to the size of its team ; Series A that put $15.6 million into the business.For users of the service, news of the funding was welcome. As was Substack’s disclosure at the time that the publications on its platform had attracted 50,000 paying subscribers. That figure was exciting, indicating that the company’s product might help writers of all sorts build a monetized audience, a holy grail for written creatives.In light of today;s updates, TechCrunch asked Substack about the progress of its monetization, specifically curious about how many paid subscribers Substack  publications had accreted. The company declined to share new numbers, with its co-founder and COO Hamish McKenzie instead saying that his team is “very happy with the growth [it has] seen over the past few months.” In a company blog post accompanying today’s news, the firm noted “tens of thousands of paying subscribers,” implying that Substack has not yet doubled its former 50,000 person subscriber base. (Doing so would give Substack six-figures worth of subscribers. However, as it reached the 50,000 paid subscriber mark less than a year ago, it might be aggressive to expect such a rapid doubling.)Newsletter, blog, websitePart of Substack’s initial success came from its intelligent blending of blogs and newsletters. Anyone who wanted to build one or the other got both, in a format that worked for each; bloggers could send email, and the email-focused also got a home on the internet. That the product came stapled to monetization tools made it all the more attractive.Today’s updates help add a new form to the Substack mix: Websites. Here’s what a new Substack website can look like:The ability to pin posts to the top of publications, the addition of photo bylines, and other tools mean that users can now do much more with the Substack publications. The company will now have to tread the line between the power of simplicity, and simply empowering its power users.The company;s model appears to be working. Traffic to the larger Substack service has risen in recent months, according to analytics service Alexa. Substack was ranked among the 13,000th most visited global site in October of last year, according to the platform. It;s now in the 11,000s. With media companies like The Dispatch hatching on Substack, and with today;s updates, expect that number to continue to fall.Substack is a bet that readers will pay for the written work that they care about. It;s a good wager. And better tools will tilt the odds more in its favor.Now we can simply count down until Substack announces 100,000 paid subscribers.",https://tcrn.ch/2TOu4Cc
1935436,2020-01-22T08:00:25,Shared inbox startup Front raises $59 million round led by other tech CEOs,"Front is raising a $59 million Series C funding round. Interestingly, the startup hasn’t raised with a traditional VC firm leading the round. A handful of super business angels are investing directly in the productivity startup and leading the round.Business angels include Atlassian co-founder and co-CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes, Atlassian President Jay Simons, Okta co-founder and COO Frederic Kerrest, Qualtrics co-founders Ryan Smith and Jared Smith and Zoom CEO Eric Yuan. Existing investors Sequoia Capital, Initialized Capital and Anthos Capital are participating in this round, as well.While Front  doesn’t share its valuation, the company says that the valuation has quadrupled compared to the previous funding round. Annual recurring venue has also quadrupled over the same period.Front raises $66 million to replace Microsoft OutlookThe structure of this round is unusual, but it’s on purpose. Front, like many other startups, is trying to redefine the future of work. That’s why the startup wanted to surround itself with leaders of other companies who share the same purpose.“First, because we didn;t need to raise (we still had two years of runway), and it;s always better to raise when we don;t need it. The last few months have given me much more clarity into our go-to-market strategy,” Front co-founder and CEO Mathilde Collin told me.Front is a collaborative inbox for your company. For instance, if you want to share an email address with your co-workers (support@mycompany.com or jobs@mycompany.com), you can integrate those shared inboxes with Front and work on those conversations as a team.It opens up a ton of possibilities. You can assign conversations to a specific person, @-mention your co-workers to send them a notification, start a conversation with your team before you hit reply, share a draft with other people, etc.Front also supports other communication channels, such as text messages, WhatsApp messages, a chat module on your website and more. As your team gets bigger, Front helps you avoid double replies by alerting other users when you’re working on a reply.In addition to those collaboration features, Front helps you automate your workload as much as possible. You can set up automated workflows so that a specific conversation ends up in front of the right pair of eyes. You can create canned responses for the entire team, as well.Front also integrates with popular third-party services, such as Salesforce, HubSpot, Clearbit and dozens of others. Front customers include MailChimp, Shopify and Stripe.While Front supports multiple channels, email represents the biggest challenge. If you think about it, email hasn’t changed much over the past decade. The last significant evolution was the rise of Gmail, G Suite and web-based clients. In other words, Front wants to disrupt Outlook and Gmail.With today’s funding round, the company plans to iterate on the product front with Office 365 support for its calendar, an offline mode and refinements across the board. The company also plans to scale up its sales and go-to-market team with an office in Phoenix and a new CMO.",https://tcrn.ch/36b0dqg

When the Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) announced the permit grantees in September, it came as a surprise to Skip, which had previously received a permit to operate as part of the city;s pilot program.Ahead of the appeal hearing, TechCrunch caught up with Skip CEO Sanjay Dastoor to learn about the company;s game plan and why he thinks it can prevail in a battle that other electric scooter providers have lost.Prior to the city;s decision last year to grant permits to Lime,  Uber;s JUMP, Bird;s  Scoot and Ford;s Spin, Skip was one of only two companies operating shared electric scooter services in San Francisco. Leading up to the new permitting application process, Skip said it had been working to ensure its electronic locks would be fully integrated by the beginning of the new permit period, Dastoor told TechCrunch. The company did this with guidance from the SFMTA, so when Skip was denied a permit, the team was caught off guard.;It was a huge surprise,; Dastoor said. ;We found out basically the same time as the press did that we didn;t get that permit, so it was pretty surprising to all of us.;",https://tcrn.ch/2RHZGqu
1936027,2020-01-22T07:20:32,"Small Door, the OneMedical for pets, launches NYC location","Small Door, a veterinary services membership startup, today announced the grand opening of its NYC location at 15 Seventh Ave. Small Door  soft-launched the space in November of 2019.The vet startup first came onto the scene in April of 2019 with a $3.5 million seed round led by Lerer Hippeau Ventures, with participation from Primary Venture Partners and Brand Foundry Ventures. Flatiron Health founders Nat Turner and Zach Weinberg, Warby Parker co-founders Dave Gilboa and Neil Blumenthal, and Sweetgreen founders Jon Neman, Nic Jammet and Nat Ru also invested.The company is taking a fresh approach to veterinary services by offering a membership program, not unlike One Medical.Part of the problem with vet services is that veterinary practices are often overworked and underpaid. This can translate to long waits for patients, short visits and a low quality of professional life for veterinarians themselves. Through a membership model, Small Door believes it can give vets more time with their pet patients and decrease wait times considerably for patients and their owners.The company has also rethought healthcare space itself. For example, the waiting room is spread out and designed with little nooks to keep animals happy and unthreatened by their fellow patients while waiting.Different membership tiers get users access to different features. For dogs, the base tier ($12/month) offers same or next-day appointments, priority access to specialists and 24/7 virtual care. The Premium tier ($75/month) offers two annual exams, core vaccinations, an annual blood panel and other preventative care like deworming, heartworm screening, etc. The Premium Plus Tier ($89/month) offers everything in the premium package alongside a 12-month supply of both flea and tick preventative treatment as well as a 12-month supply of heartworm preventative treatment.For cats, plans range from $8/month to $74/month, with similar offerings.Small Door was set up as a Public Benefit Corporation, identifying Small Door vets and pets as key stakeholders in the business. Suicide is a growing problem among vets, who often deal with mounting debt, compassion fatigue, difficult hours and even more difficult customers.Since its soft launch, 55% of Small Door customers are millennials and 70% of customers are women, according to founder Josh Guttman.",https://tcrn.ch/2NQDolf
1936003,2020-01-22T07:00:34,Fortnite just officially became a high school and college sport,"Fortnite, one of the world;s most popular games, will now be an official high school sport and college sport, thanks to an LA-based startup called PlayVS.The company has partnered with Epic Games  to bring competitive league play to the collegiate and high school level. This also marks PlayVS;s  entry into colleges and universities.PlayVS launched in April of 2018 with a mission of bringing esports to high school, with a league akin to traditional sports like basketball or football. Through a partnership with the NFHS, high schools (or parents, or the students themselves) can pay $64/player to be placed in a league to compete with neighboring schools, just like any other sport.But PlayVS partnerships go deeper than the NFHS (the NCAA of high school sports), as the company is also partnering with the publishers themselves. This is the part that puts PlayVS a step ahead of its competition, according to founder Delane Parnell .While other companies are setting up paid competitive leagues around video games, very few if any have partnerships at the publisher level. This means that those startups could be shut down on a whim by the publishers themselves, which own the IP of the game.PlayVS is the first to score such a partnership with Epic Games, the maker of the world;s most popular video game.These publisher partnerships also allow PlayVS to productize the experience in a way that requires almost no lift for schools and organizations. Players simply sign into PlayVS and get dropped into their scheduled match. At the end, PlayVS pulls stats and insights directly from the match, which can be made available to the players, coaches, fans and even recruiters.For PlayVS, the college landscape presents a new challenge. With high school expansion, the NFHS fueled fast and expansive growth. Since launch, more than 13,000 high schools have joined the waitlist to get a varsity esports team through PlayVS, which represents 68% of the country. PlayVS says that just over 14,000 high schools in the United States have a football program, to give you a comparison.The NFHS has a relationship with the NCAA, but no such official partnership has been signed, meaning that PlayVS has to go directly to individual colleges to pitch their technology. Luckily, they;re going in armed with the most popular game in the world, and at a time when many colleges are looking to incorporate esports scholarships and programs.And it doesn;t hurt that PlayVS has quite a bit of cash in the bank — the company has raised $96 million since launch.Unlike the rest of the PlayVS titles, the first season of Fortnite competition will be free to registered users, courtesy of the partnership with Epic Games. Registration for the first seasons closes on February 17 for high schools, and February 24 for colleges and universities. The season officially kicks off on March 2.The format for competition will be Duos, and organizations can submit as many teams of two as they like. The top teams will be invited to the playoffs with a chance to win a spot in the championship in May.",https://tcrn.ch/2RM4awy
1935385,2020-01-22T06:51:52,Where top VCs are investing in adtech and martech,"Lately, the venture community;s relationship with advertising tech has been a rocky one.Advertising is no longer the venture oasis it was in the past, with the flow of VC dollars in the space dropping dramatically in recent years. According to data from Crunchbase, adtech deal flow has fallen at a roughly 10% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years.While subsectors like privacy or automation still manage to pull in funding, with an estimated 90%-plus of digital ad spend growth going to incumbent behemoths like Facebook and Google, the amount of high-growth opportunities in the adtech space seems to grow narrower by the week.Despite these pains, funding for marketing technology has remained much more stable and healthy; over the last five years, deal flow in marketing tech has only dropped at a 3.5% compounded annual growth rate according to Crunchbase, with annual invested capital in the space hovering just under $2 billion.Given the movement in the adtech and martech sectors, we wanted to try to gauge where opportunity still exists in the verticals and which startups may have the best chance at attracting venture funding today.

Last week, co-founder and CEO Justin Fuisz (pictured above) told me that this was ;a really cool feature,; but that Octi;s investors pushed him ;to do more, go deeper.;Speaking of those investors, the startup says it has now raised $12 million in funding (including a previously announced seed round of $7.5 million) from Live Nation, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Peter Diamandis’ Bold Capital Partners, Human Ventures, I2BF, Day One Ventures, Tom Conrad, Scott Belsky and Josh Kushner.Last week, Fuisz demonstrated what he now sees as Octi;s  ;mic drop; moment — opening the new app and pointing his iPhone camera at a colleague. The app quickly recognized her, allowing Fuisz to send her a friend request. And once the request was accepted, Fuisz could look at her through the camera again, where she was surrounded by a floating ;belt; of virtual items that she;d created with videos, songs and photos.Octi also allows you to include fun effects and stickers. Your friends can change your profile too, making you wear a funny hat or giving you a rousing theme song for the day.To create a facial recognition experience that;s fast and simple, Fuisz said that Octi;s powered by a ;neural network on the edge,; allowing the app to process images on the device (rather than uploading them to the cloud) in a privacy-friendly way.He said the company has taken other steps to optimize the process, like prioritizing friends-of-friends rather than searching through the faces of everyone in the network, resulting in an app that can identify a friend in as little as 20 milliseconds.While Octi allows you to view friends; profiles remotely, it;s worth emphasizing that the core experience is meant to be in-person. In fact, the company provided a statement from analyst Rich Greenfield in which he described the app as ;an impressive technology that gives teens a compelling reason to be present and communicate with their phones, while gathered with their closest friends.;I wondered whether a new social dynamic also provides new opportunities for harassment and bullying, but Fuisz noted that for now, Octi profiles and belts are only visible to friends that you;ve approved. So if one of your connections is doing something you don;t like, ;You just say goodbye. That;s it. That;s a simple way of dealing with it.;Fuisz added that this initial version provides a foundation for many more experiences: ;There’s endless opportunity for games and other fun things you can do.;Ultimately, he;s hoping to turn this into a WeChat-style platform for outside developers to build social tools and content. And because Octi works on iPhone 7 and above (with plans for an Android version later this year), it can potentially reach an enormous audience out of the gate, rather than facing the scale issues of a more specialized AR or VR hardware platform.Update, January 24: After getting some questions about the privacy and security implications of the app, I asked Fuisz for more details. Here;s how he responded:All image and facial understanding data is stored locally on each individual’s personal device. The data pipeline we use is one-directional, meaning you can create an Octi ID from a face but you can’t create a face from an Octi ID. Our app utilizes a multi-dimensional vector to identify individuals, meaning, each image is broken down into a matrix that is represented by a set of numerical values, that are entirely useless without our pipeline. See below for an actual image of what a person looks like on our server, it means nothing outside the context of Octi.Niantic is working with Qualcomm on augmented reality glasses",https://tcrn.ch/2GeqGbP

TriggerMesh says the investment will be used to scale the company and grow its development team in order to offer what it bills as the industry’s first ;cloud native integration platform for the serverless era.;Founded by two prominent names in the open-source community ; Sebastien Goasguen (CEO) and Mark Hinkle (CMO), based in Geneva and North Carolina, respectively ; TriggerMesh’s platform will enable organizations to build enterprise-grade applications that span multiple cloud and data center environments, therefore helping to address what the startup says is a growing pain point as serverless architectures become more prevalent.TriggerMesh’s platform and serverless cloud bus is said to facilitate ;application flow orchestration; to consume events from any data center application or cloud event source and trigger serverless functions.;As cloud-native applications use a greater number of serverless offerings in the cloud, TriggerMesh provides a declarative API and a set of tools to define event flows and functions that compose modern applications,; explains the company.One feature TriggerMesh is specifically talking up and very relevant to legacy enterprises is its integration functionality with on-premise software. Via its wares, it says it is easy to connect SaaS, serverless cloud offerings and on-premises applications to provide scalable cloud-native applications at a low cost and quickly.“There are huge numbers of disconnected applications that are unable to fully benefit from cloud computing and increased network connectivity,” noted Scott Sage, co-founder and partner at Crane Venture Partners,  in a statement. “Most companies have some combination of cloud and on-premises applications and with more applications around, often from different vendors, the need for integration has never been greater.

Today, the company announced the launch of its Descartes Labs Platform, which promises to bring its data together with all of the tools data scientists ; including those with no background in analyzing this kind of information ; would need to work with these images to analyze them and build machine learning models based on the data in them.Descartes Labs  CEO Phil Fraher, who took this position only a few months ago, told me that the company;s current business often includes a lot of consulting work to get its customers started. These customers span the range from energy and mining companies to government agencies, financial services and agriculture businesses, but many don;t have the in-house expertise to immediately make use of the data that Descartes Labs provides.;For the most part, we still have to evangelize how to use geospatial data to solve business problems. And so a lot of our customers rely on us to do consulting,; Fraher said. ;But what;s really interesting is that even with some of our existing customers, we;re now seeing more early adopters, more business and analysis teams and data scientists being hired, that do focus on geospatial data. So what;s really exciting with this launch is we;re now going to put our platform tool in the hands of those particular individuals that now can do their own work.;In many ways, this new platform gives these customers access to the tools and data that Descartes Labs; own team uses and allows them to collaborate with the company to solve their problems and use the new modeling tools to build solutions for their individual businesses.;Previously, a data science team at a company that;s interested in this kind of analysis would also have to know how to wrangle very large-scale or petabyte-scale Earth observation data sets,; Fraher said. ;These are very unique and specific skillsets and because of that kind of barrier to entry, the adoption of some of this technology and data sources has been slow.;To enable more businesses to get started with working with this data (and become Descartes Labs customers), the company is betting on the standard tools in the industry, with hosted Jupyter notebooks, Python support and a set of APIs. It also includes tools to transform and clean the incoming data from Descartes; third-party partners in order to make it usable for data scientists.;It;s not just like some simple ETL-like data processing pipeline,; Descartes Labs; head of Engineering Sam Skillman noted. ;It;s something where we have to combine very in-depth data science, remote sensing and large-scale compute capabilities to bring all of that data in in a way that normalizes it and gets it ready for analysis.;All of this analysis is handled in the cloud, of course.The new platform is now available to businesses that want to give it a try.",https://tcrn.ch/2NP7fut
1935785,2020-01-22T05:30:28,ServiceNow acquires Loom Systems to expand AIOps coverage,"ServiceNow announced today that it has acquired Loom Systems, an Israeli startup that specializes in AIOps. The companies did not reveal the purchase price.IT operations collects tons of data across a number of monitoring and logging tools, way too much for any team of humans to keep up with. That;s why there are startups like Loom turning to AI to help sort through it. It can find issues and patterns in the data that would be challenging or impossible for humans to find. Applying AI to operations data in this manner has become known as AIOps in industry parlance.ServiceNow  is first and foremost a company trying to digitize the service process, however that manifests itself. IT service operations is a big part of that. Companies can monitor their systems, wait until a problem happens and then try to track down the cause and fix it ; or, they can use the power of artificial intelligence to find potential dangers to the system health and neutralize them before they become major problems. That;s what an AIOps product like Loom;s can bring to the table.Jeff Hausman, vice president and general manager of IT Operations Management at ServiceNow, sees Loom;s strengths merging with ServiceNow;s existing tooling to help keep IT systems running. ;We will leverage Loom Systems’  log analytics capabilities to help customers analyze data, automate remediation and reduce L1 incidents,; he told TechCrunch.Loom co-founder and CEO Gabby Menachem not surprisingly sees a similar value proposition. ;By joining forces, we have the unique opportunity to bring together our AI innovations and ServiceNow’s AIOps capabilities to help customers prevent and fix IT issues before they become problems,; he said in a statement.Loom has raised $16 million since it launched in 2015, according to PitchBook data. Its most recent round for $10 million was in November 2019. Today;s deal is expected to close by the end of this quarter.",https://tcrn.ch/2Ge7XgM
1935671,2020-01-22T05:00:57,Thundra announces $4M Series A to secure and troubleshoot serverless workloads,"Thundra, an early-stage serverless tooling startup, announced a $4 million Series A today led by Battery Ventures. The company spun out from Opsgenie after it was sold to Atlassian for $295 million in 2018.York IE, Scale X Ventures and Opsgenie founder Berkay Mollamustafaoglu also participated in the round. Battery;s Neeraj Agarwal is joining the company;s board under the terms of the agreement.The startup also announced that it had recently hired Ken Cheney as CEO, with technical founder Serkan Ozal becoming CTO.Originally, Thundra  helped run the serverless platform at Opsgenie. As a commercial company, it helps monitor, debug and secure serverless workloads on AWS Lambda. These three tasks could easily be separate tools, but Cheney says it makes sense to include them all because they are all related in some way.;We bring all that together and provide an end-to-end view of what;s happening inside the application, and this is what really makes Thundra unique. We can actually provide a high-level distributed view of that constantly changing application that shows all of the components of that application, and how they are interrelated and how they;re performing. It can also troubleshoot down to the local service, as well as go down into the runtime code to see where the problems are occurring and let you know very quickly,; Cheney explained.He says that this enables developers to get this very detailed view of their serverless application that otherwise wouldn;t be possible, helping them concentrate less on the nuts and bolts of the infrastructure, the reason they went serverless in the first place, and more on writing code.Serverless trace map in Thundra. Screenshot: ThundraThundra is able to do all of this in a serverless world, where there isn;t a fixed server and resources are ephemeral, making it difficult to identity and fix problems. It does this by installing an agent at the Lambda (AWS; serverless offering) level on AWS, or at runtime on the container at the library level, he said.Battery;s Neeraj Agarwal says having invested in Opsgenie, he knew the engineering team and was confident in the team;s ability to take it from internal tool to more broadly applicable product.;I think it has to do with the quality of the engineering team that built Opsgenie. These guys are very microservices-oriented, very product-oriented, so they;re very quick at iterating and developing products. Even though this was an internal tool I think of it as very much productized, and their ability to now sell it to the broader market is very exciting,; he said.The company offers a free version, then tiered pricing based on usage, storage and data retention. The current product is a cloud service, but it plans to add an on-prem version in the near future.Atlassian acquires OpsGenie, launches Jira Ops for managing incidents",https://tcrn.ch/30HA8xM
1935286,2020-01-22T05:00:47,"Placer.ai, a location data analytics startup, raises $12 million Series A","Placer.ai, a startup that analyzes location and foot traffic analytics for retailers and other businesses, announced today that it has closed a $12 million Series A. The round was led by JBV Capital, with participation from investors including Aleph, Reciprocal Ventures and OCA Ventures.The funding will be used on research and development of new features and to expand Placer .ai’s operation in the United States.Launched in 2016, Placer.ai’s SaaS platform gives its clients real-time data that helps them make decisions like where to rent or buy properties, when to hold sales and promotions and how to manage assets.Placer.ai analyzes foot traffic and also creates consumer profiles to help clients make marketing and ad spending decisions. It does this by collecting geolocation and proximity data from devices that are enabled to share that information. Placer.ai’s co-founder and CEO Noam Ben-Zvi says the company protects privacy and follows regulation by displaying aggregated, anonymous data and does not collect personally identifiable data. It also does not sell advertising or raw data.The company currently serves clients in the retail (including large shopping centers), commercial real estate and hospitality verticals, including JLL, Regency, SRS, Brixmor, Verizon* and Caesars Entertainment.“Up until now, we’ve been heavily focused on the commercial real estate sector, but this has very organically led us into retail, hospitality, municipalities and even [consumer packaged goods],” Ben-Zvi told TechCrunch in an email. “This presents us with a massive market, so we’re just focused on building out the types of features that will directly address the different needs of our core audience.” He adds that lack of data has hurt retail businesses with major offline operations, but that “by effectively addressing this gap, we’re helping drive more sustainable growth or larger players or minimizing the risk for smaller companies to drive expansion plans that are strategically aggressive.” Others startups in the same space include Dor, Aislelabs, RetailNext, ShopperTrak and Density. Ben-Zvi says Placer.ai wants to differentiate by providing more types of real-time data analysis. “While there are a lot of companies touching the location analytics space, we’re in a unique situation as the only company providing these deep and actionable insights for any location in the country in a real-time platform with a wide array of functionality,” he said. *Disclosure: Verizon Media is the parent company of TechCrunch.",https://tcrn.ch/2RhIhWI
1935653,2020-01-21T22:00:14,Ophelia Brown;s Blossom Capital raises new $185M European early-stage fund,"Blossom Capital, the early-stage VC firm co-founded by ex-Index Ventures and LocalGlobe VC Ophelia Brown, is announcing a second fund, less than 12 months since fund one closed.The new fund, which is described as ;heavily oversubscribed,; sits at $185 million. That;s up from $85 million first time around.Blossom;s remit remains broadly the same: to be the lead investor in European tech startups at Series A, along with doing some seed deals, too. In particular, the VC will continue to focus on finance, design, marketplaces, travel, developer-focused tools, infrastructure and ;API -first; companies.Its differentiator is pitched as so-called ;high conviction; investing, which sees it back fewer companies by writing larger cheques, along with claiming to have close ties to U.S. top tier investors ready to back portfolio companies at the next stage.And whilst a ;bridge to the valley; is a well worn claim by multiple European VCs, Blossom;s track record so far bears this is out somewhat, even if it is nascent. Of the firm;s portfolio, travel booking platform Duffel has received two follow-on investment rounds led by Benchmark and Index Ventures; cybersecurity automation platform Tines received follow-on investment led by Accel Partners; and payments unicorn Checkout.com is also backed by Insight Partners.In addition, I understand that about half of Blossom;s LPs are in the U.S., and that all of the firm;s original LPs invested in this second fund, which Brown concedes was a lot easier to raise than the first. That;s presumably down to the up round valuations Blossom is already able to tout.Citing benchmark data from Cambridge Associates  and Preqin, Blossom says it sits in the top 5% of funds of 2018/2019 vintage in the U.S. and EU. Although, less than two years old, I would stress that it is still very early days.More broadly, Brown and Blossom;s other partners ; Imran Gohry, Louise Samet and Mike Hudack  ; argue that the most successful European companies historically are those that were able to attract U.S. investors but that companies no longer need to relocate to the U.S. to seize the opportunity.“When we looked at the data it was very clear at the growth stage that, outside of Index and Accel,  the most successful European outcomes were driven by the combination of European early-stage investors and top-tier U.S. growth investors,” explained Blossom Capital partner, Imran Ghory, in a statement. “From day one we prioritised building those relationships, both to share knowledge but also provide a bridge for European founders to access the best growth capital as they scale;.We updated this report with a correction; the original said the fund is less than a year old ; in fact it;s less than two years old",https://tcrn.ch/2GeYKEW

Leading the round is Goldman Sachs Growth, with participation from Bpifrance via its Growth Fund Large Venture.Others participating include Idinvest Partners, Iris Capital, and Famille C (the family office of Courtin-Clarins). The round brings the total raised by the French company to around $100 million.Founded in Paris back in 2012, before launching today;s proposition in 2015, LumApps  has developed what it describes as a ;social intranet; for enterprises to enable employees to better informed, connect and collaborate. The SaaS integrates with other enterprise software such as G Suite, Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft SharePoint, to centralize access to corporate content, business applications and social features under a single platform. The central premise is to help companies ;break down silos; and streamline internal communication.LumApps customers include Airbus, Veolia, Valeo, Air Liquide, Colgate-Palmolive, The Economist, Schibsted, EA, Logitech, Toto, and Japan Airlines, and the company claims to have achieved year-on-year revenue growth of 100%.“Our dream was to enable access to useful information in one click, from one place and for everyone,; LumApps founder and CEO Sébastien Ricard told TechCrunch when the company raised its Series B early last year. ;We wanted to build a solution that bridged [an] intranet and social network, with the latest new technologies. A place that users will love.”Since then, LumApps has added several new offices and has seven worldwide: Lyon, Paris, London, New York, Austin, San Francisco, and Tokyo. Armed with additional funding, the company will continue adding significant headcount, hiring across engineering, product, sales and marketing. There are also plans to expand to Canada, more of Asia Pacific, and Germany.;We’re actually looking at hiring 200 people minimum,; Ricard tells me. ;We’re growing fast and have ambitious plans to take the product to new heights, including fulfilling our vision of making LumApps a personal assistant powered by AI. This will require a significant investment in top engineering/AI talent globally;.Asked to elaborate on what machine learning and AI could bring to a social intranet, Ricard says the vision is to make LumApps a personal assistant for all communications and workflows in the enterprise.;We see a future where this personal assistant can make predictive suggestions based on historical data and actions. Applying AI to prompt authors with suggested content, flagging important items that demand attention, and auto-archiving old content, are a few examples. Managing the massive troves of content and data companies have today is critical;.Ricard also sees AI playing a big role in data security. ;Employees have a high-degree of control with regard to data sharing and AI can help manage what employees can share in the workplace. This is more long-term but it’s where we’re headed,; he says.;In the short-term, we’re making investments in automating as many workflows as possible with the goal of reducing or eliminating administrative tasks that keep employees from more productive tasks, including team collaboration and knowledge sharing;.Meanwhile, LumApps says it may also use part of the Series C for M&amp;A activity. ;We’re growing fast and we’re looking at different areas for expansion opportunities,; Ricard says. ;This includes retail and manufacturing and some business functions like HR, marketing and communications. We don’t have concrete plans to acquire any companies at the moment but we are keeping our options open as acquiring best-in-breed technologies often makes more sense from a business perspective than building it yourself;.",https://tcrn.ch/2G8NlGC

The latter will be integrated into the former, but it seems to be a happy collaboration rather than a consolidation of necessity.Monarq was founded three years ago by Irene Ryabaya and Diana Murakhovskaya, and 32 companies have gone through its process. FFA has accepted half that number into its program as of the second cohort, with a third underway for 2020. I covered graduate Give InKind in November when it raised a $1.5 million seed round.Give InKind;s smarter giving platform brings in surprise $1.5 million in pre-seed funding;Monarq and FFA share a common sponsor that introduced us years ago, and we;ve been connected and supportive of each other since,; explained FFA CEO Leslie Feinzaig to TechCrunch. ;This year, Diana and Irena;s side gigs started to take off — Diana raised a $20 million VC fund, and Irena;s startup, WarmIntro, started signing up substantial customers. It made strategic sense for FFA to solidify our national expansion and strengthen our network of investors and mentors that are East Coast based.;Ryabaya and Murakhovskaya will be focusing on The Artemis Fund and WarmIntro respectively, and Monarq;s accelerator will be tucked into the Ready Set Raise brand. The merge will create what FFA claims is the country;s largest network of female and non-binary industry folks, which should prove an asset for those in the program.It;s possible to see this as consolidation within a specialized branch of the startup industry, but Feinzaig said business is booming.;The market for women;s leadership is absolutely growing, and creating a lot of opportunities in the process,; she said. ;What;s different now is that there is a recognition that this is good business, not a charitable cause.;The FFA;s stated goal of gender parity among founders only grows more achievable with increased reach. It may be that the increased scale also improves results in an already impressive portfolio.",https://tcrn.ch/30JzUWQ
